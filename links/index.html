Not how do I enjoy this situation. How do we both enjoy it. This has fantastic results, because you aren’t giving too much of yourself away. [...] See how it transforms people-pleasing into creating a shared joy."</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://www.deliberatehappiness.com/home/how-to-know-and-do-what-you-actually-want-not-just-what-you-think-others-want">How to know and do what you actually want, not just what you think others want</a></b>: "[I]t’s fine to try to make others like you. It’s just that it’s better to do it consciously. [...] If you think about pleasing people as one of your goals and pursue it on purpose, you can find paths that lead to a helluva lot more flourishing than bumbling about with your eyes closed and hoping for the best. The main method I’ve seen work for this is to do what you enjoy then find people who like and respect you for doing those things. [...] One tool I like is to imagine a scenario where nobody will ever know that you did it. [...] Do you still do it? A common example is reading the classics. If nobody ever knew you did it, would you really read Shakespeare, written in such a different English that each sentence takes forever to parse? Or would you watch an amazing drama on Netflix? Sure, Shakespeare makes timeless commentary on the human experience, but so does Game of Thrones"</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/12/is-it-ethical-to-use-amazon">Is it ethical to use Amazon?</a></b>: "I have no good answers to the Amazon problem, because I hold two beliefs that contradict each other and I haven’t found a way to reconcile them: (1) what’s wrong is not the act of purchasing from Amazon, but what Amazon does to its employees, and since there would be nothing wrong with purchasing from Amazon if it was, say, a worker cooperative, the demand should be “democratize it” rather than “stop using it.” (2) You shouldn’t buy from companies with highly unethical business practices, such as staying in a hotel that fired striking workers, or buying slave-made goods. I wrestle with this constantly, because Amazon is very difficult to avoid[. ...] Nobody wants to be complicit in evil, but we’re all complicit in some evil, so what are our responsibilities as individuals?

If you set a new PR (personal record) for yourself, you should be celebrating, whether that was for a 15 minute mile or a 4:30 minute mile. If you just went further than you’ve ever gone before, no matter the distance, that’s amazing too! If you just got out there and ran today at all and that’s a win for you, celebrate it. I only hope that my accomplishments (or failures) never discourage you because my challenges are not your challenges and I want to celebrate your wins with you.

In symbolic terms, the Transcendent occupies a middle position between Philosopher & Antiphilosopher. At first, Manhattan seems to side with Veidt. He kills Rorschach, keeping Veidt's secret plan secret (thus preserving its efficacy). But Dr. Manhattan isn't on Veidt's side. Sure, it's better for Veidt's plan to come off, but not on the grand scale that Veidt was imagining. The Philosopher-King's plan had become his life, his whole identity wrapped up in it. Who is he, if not the savior of the world? From the transcendent point of view, the world can't be saved. Matter will continue to combine & break apart, creating new forms & destroying them. If humanity were wiped out by nuclear holocaust, things would still keep happening. Matter can't be destroyed. This is a scary point of view. It's cold, detached, inhuman. Yet it's probably the most clear-seeing of the three."</li>

The purpose is to make the other person feel valuable and connected. It's important to actually make connections - find opportunities across employees. 1:1s are more for employees than managers, as while the manager can always speak directly to the employee, the inverse isn’t always true. You do need an agenda. 1:1's help reduce uncertainty. It can be good to help the employee prioritize, make action items, and clarify vision.</li>

Or why the “Netflix Culture” won’t work in your company.</a></b>: It's hard to apply culture from other companies to your company because you rarely get the full story, other factors are different, and because of mere survivorship bias. Some generalizable lessons though: recruiting and hiring is the most important thing; regular 1-1s are important; different cultures can be successful but you do need a strong, clearly articulable culture; a good culture emphasizes psychological safety and allows for diversity of people and ways of doing things; don't write down your company culture until you had at least 20 employees; DRIs (Directly Responsible Individuals) and OKRs (Objectives + Key Results) are useful; and give thought to how processes will work.</li>

The good news is that there’s really only two things that it boils down to: Have a centralized recruiting process with a consistent high bar [and r]educe the task overhead to a minimum. If you don’t have those things, there’s no point trying to hire super senior people: and in particular you are probably better off hiring average engineers."</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/my-personal-reactions-to-confrontational-animal-activism/">My Personal Reactions to Confrontational Animal Activism</a></b>: Animal activists, and most reformers throughout history, have debated whether to make their case in a professional, moderate manner or whether to protest more confrontationally. This is a difficult issue, and given the persistence of the question, there probably aren't easy answers. In this piece, I share my personal reactions to aggressive activism, as one anecdotal data point to inform the broader discussion. While I personally am turned away by confrontation, the historical record may point in a different direction, so I maintain agnosticism about how activists can make the biggest difference.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/09/26/misc-unsolicited-career-advice.html">Miscellaneous unsolicited (and possibly biased) career advice</a></b>: Pick the fastest growing company you can find. Focus on human capital over financial capital early on. Seek out people you can learn from. Consider an industry where there aren't that many smart people. Change jobs when you're no longer learning. Do a lot of internships. Prioritize credentialism based on the cost-benefit. Read all the time. You probably won't learn something if you don't enjoy the process of learning it. Don't forget to also learn communication, sales, self-sufficiently, and statistics.</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://paulgraham.com/kids.html">Having Kids</a></b>: "When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically, because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at all. 'Better you than me,' I was thinking. Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world. What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded turned out to be wonderful."</li>

  <li><b><a href="https://www.askamathematician.com/2016/06/q-what-are-actual-pictures-of-atoms-actually-pictures-of/">Q: What are “actual pictures” of atoms actually pictures of?</a></b>: Light can't be used to photograph an atom because the wavelength of light is longer than the size of the atom. Instead, a scanning electron microscope is &ldquo;a needle with a point that is a single atom (literally, it is the pointiest thing possible) which it uses to measure subtle electrical variations (such as a stray atom sitting on what was otherwise a very flat, clean surface). The 'Tunneling Electron' bit of the name refers to the nature of the electrical interaction being used to detect the presence of atoms; when the tip is brought close to an atom electrons will quantum tunnel between them and the exchange of electrons is a detectable as a current. The 'Scanning' bit of the name refers to how this is used to generate a picture: by scanning back and forth across a surface over and over until you’ve bumped every atom with your needle several times. The pictures so generated aren’t photographs, they’re maps of what the STM’s needle experienced as it was moved over the surface. The STM 'sees' atoms using this needle in the same way you can 'see' the bottom of a muddy river with a pokin’ stick.&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</li>

Furthermore, with tighter content schedules and a never-ending demand for new content, plagiarism is more tempting than ever. This has the impact of making plagiarism, or at least the detection of plagiarism, much more common.

Take what will meaningfully help you advance your career and let the rest flow by. There’ll always be more tomorrow. Do keep having fun!

You think a cable lock will keep your beloved wheels in your life. The thief knows a simple pair of aviation snips cuts through that cable like butter. You’re convinced a locker-style combination lock will outsmart a crook. He pops it in seconds with a shim—just slides it in between the body of the lock and its fishhook tip, and your bike is his. (A good bandit can make a shim in about five minutes with nothing more than a beer can and a pair of scissors.) U-locks? Routinely opened with a Bic pen jammed into the keyhole. Even with that rare unbreakable lock, a bike is no safer than its anchor; outside Guthrie Hall at the University of Washington sits a metal rack that bike thieves have sawed straight through.

No one knew the full extent of my situation but me, and I was in denial. It’s worth taking a moment to ask yourself: Do I feel guilty or anxious when I’m not working? Have I stopped playing with my friends? Do all of my daily activities revolve around building a more successful career? Am I always sleeping fewer than eight hours per night? Am I consuming stimulants multiple times per day to hide my exhaustion? Am I sitting still and staring at screens for most of my waking hours? Do I interact with people primarily through screens? Am I indoors all day long, depriving myself of fresh air and sunlight? Do I depend on alcohol or drugs to cope with social situations outside of work? If you said ‘yes’ to most of those questions, you are not alone. When I was at my worst, I was doing all of these things on a daily basis. I was fueling my own anxiety and I couldn’t even see it. My perceived lack of productivity, lack of money, and the unknown future kept me in a constant state of panic.&rdquo</li>

You want to be preparing yourself for the long-haul. If it’s easier at the end, then an intense approach makes pushing through that initial challenge more likely.&rdquo; Habits work well for easier goals, whereas intensity works well for harder goals. &ldquo;If your habits don’t line up with the typical intensity required to reach the level of success you want, you won’t get there even if you’re perfectly consistent.&rdquo; Habits also work well for things you don't want to focus on, whereas intensity works well for your main focus.</li>

Is it really as simple as 'calories in, calories out' (i.e., eat less than you burn), or is what you eat more important than how much?  Is '3500 calories equals one poun'” a useful rule of thumb, or just a myth? [...] Following is a description of my attempt to answer some of these questions, using a relatively simple mathematical model, in an experiment involving daily measurement of weight, caloric intake, and exercise over 75 days. The results suggest that you can not only measure, but predict future weight loss– or gain– with surprising accuracy.  But they also raise some interesting open questions about how all this relates to the effectiveness of some currently popular diet programs.&rdquo;</li>

In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Specifically, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics, and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO2 and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2 (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts, and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.&rquo;</li>

This is because you really need to avoid a situation where the mother has a much better understanding of the baby than you do.

Our analysis is based on over one hundred machine learning competitions hosted on the Kaggle platform over the course of several years. In each competition, numerous practitioners repeatedly evaluated their progress against a holdout set that forms the basis of a public ranking available throughout the competition. Performance on a separate test set used only once determined the final ranking. By systematically comparing the public ranking with the final ranking, we assess how much participants adapted to the holdout set over the course of a competition.

Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem. These results suggest some of the ways in which key notions of fairness are incompatible with each other, and hence provide a framework for thinking about the trade-offs between them. </li>

You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started. When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster.

[However,] Russian procurement dwarfs that of most European powers combined. [...] The reason for this apparent contradiction is that the use of market exchange rates grossly understates the real volume of Russian military expenditure (and that of other countries with smaller per-capita incomes, like China). Instead, any analysis of comparative military expenditure should be based on the use of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates rather than market exchange rates. [...] As we demonstrate, despite some shortcomings, PPP is a much more methodologically robust and defensible method of comparing defense spending across countries[. ...] Using PPP, one finds that Russia's effective military expenditure actually ranged between $150 billion and $180 billion annually over the last five years. That figure is conservative; taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure, Russia may well come in at around $200 billion. [...] The gap is even narrower when one digs into the differences in how this money is spent. At nearly 50 percent of federal budget spending on national defense, a large proportion of the Russian defense budget goes to procurement and research and development. By comparison, in other countries with large defense budgets, procurement spending tends to be much lower: in India, the United States, and the United Kingdom, spending is at about 20–25 percent. Unlike some other large military spenders - for example, Saudi Arabia and India - Russia also produces most of its weaponry itself and does not buy its equipment from countries with higher costs.&rdquo;</li>

It is obvious that phones are deeply ingrained into our lives, but what is interesting is that the data shows that phone usage may not take away from time spent on other social activities. When it comes to homework, exercise, and going to class, spending time on ones' phone does not take away time spent on those activities. Additionally, for every hour of time spent on a Smartphone, time spent in meetings, eating (presumably with friends), and time spent with friends goes up.

In the reverse case, a time-traveler from the past to the future wishes to prove he is from the past and that time-travel is real. How can he do this when all past knowledge is already known or whose chain of custody being broken is more likely than time-travel being real? I suggest 8 methods: carbon-14 nuclear isotope dating of their body as isotopes cannot be removed; sequencing of their genome to check consistency with pedigree as human genomes cannot be synthesized or edited on a large scale; selection & mutation clocks, likewise; immune system signatures of extinct or rare diseases such as smallpox, and accumulated pollution such as heavy metals, difficult & dangerous to fake. While these proofs may not offer conclusive proof since any human system can be subverted with enough effort, they can provide enough evidence to launch research into time travel and a definitive finding.&rdquo;</li>

The official statistics are confusing, but they show no signs of increases in this phenomenon. On the other hand, there are signs of technological underemployment – robots taking middle-skill jobs and then pushing people into other jobs. [...] This sort of thing has been happening for centuries and in theory everyone should eventually adjust, but there are some signs that they aren't. This may have as much to do with changes to the educational, political, and economic system as with the nature of robots per se. Economists are genuinely divided on how this is going to end up, and whether this will just be a temporary blip while people develop new skills, or the new normal. Technology seems poised to disrupt lots of new industries very soon, and could replace humans entirely sometime within the next hundred years. This is a very depressing conclusion. If technology didn't cause problems, that would be great. If technology made lots of people unemployed, that would be hard to miss, and the government might eventually be willing to subsidize something like a universal basic income. But we won't get that. We'll just get people being pushed into worse and worse jobs, in a way that does not inspire widespread sympathy or collective action.

I remember reading about it as a student 40 years ago and thinking it was a good idea. And I was not alone in that judgment: In 1968, more than 1000 economists signed a letter endorsing such a plan, including luminaries like James Tobin, Paul Samuelson, Peter Diamond, and Martin Feldstein. Andrew Yang&rsquo;s version, which focuses on taxing consumption rather than income, is even better than Friedman&rsquo;s, because it wouldn&rsquo;t distort the incentive to save and invest.&rdquo;</li>

Rates and time vary with the discipline of the degree achieved and the amount of tuition assistance the student obtained. An ISA is dramatically more student-friendly than a loan. All the risk shifts from the student to the investing entity; if a career starts slowly, or not at all, the student&rsquo;s obligation drops or goes to zero. Think of an ISA as equity instead of debt, or as working one&rsquo;s way through college &mdash; after college.

Yet when it comes to financing the venture of one&rsquo;s own life suddenly equity becomes akin to slavery and debt bondage becomes freedom! It&rsquo;s very peculiar.

For Democrats the share was just over six percent in 1972, but it&rsquo;s dropped in half by 2018. For Republicans the climb has been upward, with just under 5% being totally opposed to abortion in 1972 compared to 8.5% of Republicans in 2018. [&hellip;T]he share of Republicans who wanted to place no restrictions on abortion was the same as the Democrats in the 1970&rsquo;s. Then, support for that position began to drop. However, the decline was much steeper for Republicans &ndash; 40% of Republican were totally pro-choice in the 1970&rsquo;s, but that fell to just under 15% by the mid-2000&rsquo;s, only to rebound about five percentage points recently. The Democrats have seen a slightly different pattern. From their high of 37% completely pro-choice in the early 1970&rsquo;s, they dropped to just above 20% in the mid-2000&rsquo;s. There was a big bounce back for Democrats, though. Now about 35% of Democrats could be called completely pro-choice. The gap between two parties on the 100% pro-choice group is now the largest it&rsquo;s ever been, with Democrats being twice as likely to always favor abortion than Republicans. One would have to think that an individual&rsquo;s view of abortion is based, in large part, on their religious tradition. The data largely confirms that, but there are some interesting results. Of the group of people who favor a woman&rsquo;s choice to an abortion in all six scenarios, just over a third are religiously unaffiliated. However, the group that shows up the second most is Catholics. Obviously, that&rsquo;s a function of the size of the Catholic population in the United States, but it also speaks to the fact that lots of Catholics are diametrically opposed to the Church&rsquo;s teaching on abortion. That comes even more into focus when considering that despite the fact that evangelicals made up nearly a quarter of the sample, they are just 12.7% of 100% pro-choice respondents. When looking at those who are 100% pro-life, it&rsquo;s basically evangelicals, Catholics, and then everyone else. Nearly half of all 100% pro-life people are evangelicals, while 30% are Catholics.&rdquo;</li>

Sunstein, co-author of Nudge, Obama White House official, and by far the most cited legal scholar of the late 2000s, aims to unravel the mystery and figure out the implications in his new book How Change Happens. He pulls together three phenomena which social scientists have studied in recent decades: preference falsification, variable thresholds for action, and group polarisation. If Sunstein is to be believed, together these are a cocktail for social shifts that are chaotic and fundamentally unpredictable. In brief, people constantly misrepresent their true views, even to close friends and family. They themselves aren&rsquo;t quite sure how socially acceptable their feelings would have to become before they revealed them or joined a campaign for change. And a chance meeting between a few strangers can be the spark that radicalises a handful of people who then find a message that can spread their beliefs to millions. According to Sunstein, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;much, much easier&rdquo; to create social change when large numbers of people secretly or latently agree with you. But &lsquo;preference falsification&rsquo; is so pervasive that it&rsquo;s no simple matter to figure out when they do.&rdquo;</li>

The most important thing to remember is that success in subscription video services requires two things: Getting a subscriber, and keeping a subscriber. The second is harder. Much harder. And since we are giving out free advice, here are 10 tips for the current and future contenders: 1. Spend today on the content library that will make financial sense five years from now. [&hellip;, ] 2. The only arbiters of the quality of your content and service is the audience. [&hellip;] Audiences like content that is &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; They even like pretending they don&rsquo;t like certain content and will go out of their way to complain about it. [&hellip;] You probably need more content than you think. If your audience isn&rsquo;t complaining about having too many series they want to watch, they&rsquo;ll pause their subscription and come back when you have them. [&hellip;] At a certain point, the value of unwatched content is negative, not zero. [&hellip;] You don&rsquo;t need sophisticated metrics to tell if your audience likes your content. All you need to know is, &ldquo;Are they coming back?&rdquo; The more complicated the analysis, the more likely it has been exaggerated. 3. The best way to build your streaming subscription service is to rebrand and cannibalize another business that already has lots of users and, ideally, money. [&hellip;] 4. If you actually want to make money, subscription streaming shouldn&rsquo;t even be your real business. Instead, give it away as a free or low-cost perk that&rsquo;s part of a much higher-margin and less-competitive business, such as wireless service, smartphones, e-commerce subscriptions, or theme park passes. [&hellip;] 6. Ultimately, you need hits. A single breakout can double your subscriber growth (though again, you&rsquo;ll need more hits to keep these subscribers), but a bunch of niche &ldquo;hits&rdquo; makes only for a niche service. Unfortunately, these hits are hard to produce and even harder to predict. So when you think you&rsquo;ve got one, pay whatever it takes to get the rights, reshoot a pilot, or fix the creative. [&hellip;] 9. To be successful, you have to solve a problem. This cannot be a problem you created. A few hardcore fans might chase Jim and Pam across the streaming landscape, but most will just watch something other than The Office. But if you say, &ldquo;We are the home for all things Marvel,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll happily choose you over sifting through Triple Frontier and The Ridiculous Six to find Thor: Ragnarok.&rdquo;</li>

Despite that, we operate more like a tech company than a social enterprise. Our investors are venture capitalists trying to make a high return, and they hold us to the same standards of growth rate and unit economics as any developed-world startup. This might seem like a downside (surely it would be easier to directly optimize for impact rather than have pressure from investors to make money?), but for us it&rsquo;s actually increased our impact in two ways. First, the pressure to grow quickly forces us to make our product better and scale faster, so we help more people by a larger amount. Second, since we&rsquo;ve done really well by for-profit investors&rsquo; standards, we can raise much more money than a nonprofit or social enterprise. [&hellip;] The &ldquo;local context plus high standards&rdquo; theory suggests a simple (though not easy!) strategy to build a high-quality business that helps the global poor: (1) Move to a developing country to understand your future users, (2) Learn the startup playbook (for instance, by doing Y Combinator), (3) Start a business whose users are in the place you live.

You should not have to claim some unusual level of diligence to feel entitled to a good standard of living. [&hellip;] If there were some sort of way of quantifying &lsquo;hard work,&rsquo; through which you could prove that your wealth was truly earned, is there any possible way one could show that they had &lsquo;earned&rsquo; a billion dollars? Do billionaires work that many magnitudes more hours than waitresses? Is their work that many magnitudes more strenuous? Are they that many magnitudes more stressed? (Billionaires might believe so; that just shows they&rsquo;ve never been waitresses.) Brandishing the concept of &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; in order to justify why some people live in miserable poverty and others have sports car collections is just nonsensical, an obvious distraction away from the question of why these disparities are so vast and unjust. Honestly, &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; is such a vague and slippery concept that we&rsquo;d probably all be better off if we just threw it out. And once we stop playing this pointless game of comparing how hard we all work, we can start asking the real question of when we&rsquo;re going to start being compensated fairly for it.&rdquo;</li>

Nothing else had changed because nothing else had to; the underlying itch being scratched was the same. They just had to CTRL+F and replace a couple of keywords. Eventually, things came full circle. I started this essay with a memory of noticing that my favorite early-2000s-era website had two off-topic forums: one for religion vs. atheism, and one for everything else. Earlier this year, SSC&rsquo;s subreddit split in two: one for &ldquo;culture war&rdquo; discussions mostly about race and gender, the other for everything else. [&hellip;] I&rsquo;ve lost the exact quote, but a famous historian once said that we learn history to keep us from taking the present too seriously. This isn&rsquo;t to say the problems of the present aren&rsquo;t serious. Just that history helps us avoid getting too dazzled by current trends, or too swept away by any particular narrative. If this is true, we might do well to study the history of New Atheism a little more seriously.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/02/the-radicalism-of-equal-opportunity">The Radicalism of Equal Opportunity</a></b>:  &nbsp;&ldquo;You will often hear a distinction drawn between two different kinds of equality: equality of &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; and equality of &lsquo;outcome.&rsquo; The people who draw this distinction often say that they believe in the former but not the latter. Equality of &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; is desirable, but equality of &lsquo;outcome&rsquo; is not. As they frame it, one of these is fairly basic while the other is radical and frightening. [&hellip;] The people who distinguish opportunity and outcome often do so in order to discourage us from trying to redistribute wealth from rich to poor&mdash;what matters is not whether people end up highly unequal, but whether they have the same opportunities at the start. If life is a race, it&rsquo;s okay if there are &lsquo;winners&rsquo; and &lsquo;losers&rsquo; so long as the race is played fairly. [&hellip;] But there are severe problems with this way of looking at things. For one, it makes no sense. It sounds nice, but when you start examining it closely, the boundaries between &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; and &lsquo;outcome&rsquo; become very unclear. One generation&rsquo;s outcomes structure the next generation&rsquo;s opportunities. Let&rsquo;s say we start with a fair economic &lsquo;race,&rsquo; but then a few people become much richer than others. Those people can send their children to private schools, they can pass on all of their connections and knowledge and wealth to their children. Even if Generation A has equal opportunities, Generation A&rsquo;s unequal outcomes mean that Generation B will have dramatic variations in opportunities. If you want to create equal opportunities, you&rsquo;ll have to constantly be meddling with outcomes.&rdquo;</li>

  <li><b><a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1180151670744834053">Neoliberalism: a thread</a></b>:  &nbsp;&ldquo;To most of the people who bash &lsquo;neoliberalism&rsquo;, the word means free-market libertarianism - the ideology of Milton Friedman, Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Reagan. But to the people who call themselves &lsquo;neoliberal&rsquo; now, it does not mean that. The people who now call themselves &ldquo;neoliberals&rdquo; are the heirs to a different tradition - the liberals of the 1990s who responded to the failure of communism and the excesses of libertarianism by creating a new, center-left technocratic policy program. [&hellip;] Neoliberalism, as defined by its current adherents (rather than by its squawking enemies), views markets as the fundamental generators of prosperity, and government as the way to distribute that prosperity more equitably. [&hellip;] It sees free trade and globalization, along with strong welfare states in rich countries, as the best way to make the world more prosperous and more equal at the same time. [&hellip;] Now, am I really a neoliberal? [..] No. I am not[. ..] I&rsquo;ve come to believe in export promotion, which is anathema to many neoliberals, since it&rsquo;s a restriction on free trade. [&hellip;] The government *must* pick winners. Green energy and other zero-carbon technologies being chief among the things we must pick. I also believe in national health insurance, which is just straight-up nationalization of a major industry. So there are many ways in which my economic ideas diverge strongly from neoliberalism (that was not an exhaustive list). But just because I&rsquo;m not really a neoliberal doesn&rsquo;t mean I think neoliberalism is bad. I think it&rsquo;s a valuable perspective we still need. Just as free-market libertarianism went too far, so will the new socialism go too far someday (if it ever manages to take power). We will need people who remember the value of markets, but who are NOT plutocrats or racists, to temper and restrain that overreach. If the job of restraining the inevitable excesses of socialism doesn&rsquo;t fall to the Clintonite technocratic center-left, it will fall to the right - to libertarians, racist &ldquo;economic nationalists&rdquo;, etc. And that would be bad. Neoliberals&rsquo; disagreement with leftists comes less from their goals - both want a prosperous, equal society - but from the methods they think will be most effective for getting there. And that is a healthy disagreement. Or it should be, anyway.&rdquo;</li>

  <li><b><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/options">Stock options are really complicated</a></b>:  &nbsp;&ldquo;Owning stock options is different (and worse) than directly owning equity in a company. That&rsquo;s because you need to exercise them&ndash;i.e., pay the company money&ndash;in order to exchange the option for &nbsp;actual shares. Exercising the options costs a lot of money, so all else equal you would want to wait until the you&rsquo;re sure the stock is valuable to exercise. (For instance, you might wait until the company goes public, so you know you can sell the stock on the stock market.) But there are two downsides to that approach. First, depending on your company&rsquo;s policies, you might have to give up your options if you leave or are fired. Second, if you sell the stock too soon after you exercise the options, you&rsquo;ll get much worse tax treatment. That means &nbsp;you&rsquo;ll be caught between (a) paying twice as much in taxes as an equity holder, or (b) risking losing most of your gains because the stock price moved against you at the wrong time. So from a tax perspective, the best time to exercise the options is as soon as they&rsquo;re granted to you (before they even vest). This is known as &ldquo;early exercise&rdquo; or an &ldquo;83(b) election.&rdquo; Unfortunately, early exercise can cost a lot of money up front, and if the company doesn&rsquo;t succeed, you&rsquo;ll lose it all.

The loss of trust mostly isn&rsquo;t the pollsters&rsquo; fault. It&rsquo;s the media&rsquo;s fault. Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m going there.

No, not quite. Instead, you need a sum of squares formula. To save you some math, here are a few useful benchmarks: For a high-quality, 1,000-person national poll, a good estimate of the true margin of error is about plus or minus 4 percentage points. For a national polling average, meanwhile, the true margin of error is about plus or minus 3 percentage points.

And because of the shift to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, this will eventually happen. [&hellip;] But banning fracking too quickly might jeopardize this crucial transition. Why? Because switching to renewable energy requires a lot of energy. Solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric cars must be manufactured in huge quantities. Buildings must be retrofitted with new electrical wiring and energy efficiency technologies. [&hellip;] All of this will take huge amounts of energy &ndash; electricity and vehicle fuel. Where will it come from? Currently, renewable sources account for only 11% of U.S. primary energy consumption.

The U.S. simply isn&rsquo;t there yet &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have enough green energy to power the transition. Instead, if fracking is banned immediately, the U.S. will probably go back to using coal and imported oil (Sanders has also proposed banning the other option, nuclear power). This will mean much greater carbon emission and deadly air pollution from coal. It will also would push up global oil prices, generating big windfalls for leaders like Russia&rsquo;s President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Mohammad Bin Salman.

A +1 SD better teacher might cause a +0.1 SD year-on-year improvement in test scores. This decays quickly with time and is probably disappears entirely after four or five years, though there may also be small lingering effects. It&rsquo;s hard to rule out the possibility that other factors, like endogenous sorting of students, or students&rsquo; genetic potential, contributes to this as an artifact, and most people agree that these sorts of scores combine some signal with a lot of noise. For some reason, even though teachers&rsquo; effects on test scores decay very quickly, studies have shown that they have significant impact on earning as much as 20 or 25 years later, so much so that kindergarten teacher quality can predict thousands of dollars of difference in adult income. This seemingly unbelievable finding has been replicated in quasi-experiments and even in real experiments and is difficult to banish. Since it does not happen through standardized test scores, the most likely explanation is that it involves non-cognitive factors like behavior. I really don&rsquo;t know whether to believe this and right now I say 50-50 odds that this is a real effect or not &ndash; mostly based on low priors rather than on any weakness of the studies themselves.

There is medium evidence that this is also true for upper-to-medium-tier colleges. It is still easy to get into medium-to-lower-tier colleges. Until 1900, there was no competition for top colleges, medical schools, or law schools. A secular trend towards increasing admissions (increasing wealth + demand for skills?) plus two shocks from the GI Bill and the Vietnam draft led to a glut of applicants that overwhelmed schools and forced them to begin selecting applicants. Changes up until ten years ago were because of a growing applicant pool, after which the applicant pool (both domestic and international) stopped growing and started shrinking. Increased competition since ten years ago does not involve applicant pool size. Changes after ten years ago are less clear, but the most important factor is probably the ease of applying to more colleges. [&hellip;] All the hand-wringing about getting into good colleges is probably a waste of time, unless you are from a disadvantaged background.

And if crime goes down and the government saves on prisons, the corporation gets half the savings (or a third, or whatever). Zero taxpayer money gets risked. It is entirely up to the corporation to fund the problem-solving effort. If they fail, then it&rsquo;s their own loss. If they succeed, then the government pays them money, but less than the government made, so the taxpayers still get a profit. [&hellip;] This is looking impressively close to prediction markets.

But does it really make sense to care about promises more than people? That sounds terribly perverse! Promises can be a useful tool for coordination, and hence serving our collective interests.

My hypothesis &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true &ndash; is that this is only cliched now because Sartre won. The point of studying Sartre is not to learn that you choose your own identity, but to read him backward &ndash; to start with this idea that choosing your own identity is obvious, and then read Sartre to learn exactly how controversial it was at the time and what sorts of arguments Sartre had to go through to get people to accept it, and eventually understand the position that the original reader of Sartre was supposed to have started with.&rdquo;</li>

People who grow up with a religion learn how to cope with its more inconvenient parts by partitioning them off, rationalizing them away, or forgetting about them. Religious communities actually protect their members from religion in one sense &ndash; they develop an unspoken consensus on which parts of their religion members can legitimately ignore.

Indeed, under the Bayesian definition of evidence, &ldquo;strong evidence&rdquo; is just that sort of evidence which we only expect to find on one side of an argument.

  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2n5/selffulfilling_correlations/">Self-Fulfilling Correlations</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Correlation does not imply causation. Sometimes corr(X,Y) means X=&gt;Y; sometimes it means Y=&gt;X; sometimes it means W=&gt;X, W=&gt;Y. And sometimes it&rsquo;s an artifact of people&rsquo;s beliefs about corr(X, Y). With intelligent agents, perceived causation causes correlation. [...] Are vegetarian diets or yoga healthy for you? Does using the phone while driving increase accident rates? Yes, probably; but there is a self-fulfilling component in the data that is difficult to factor out.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/4575/">Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond?</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;The diamond invention&mdash;the creation of the idea that diamonds are rare and valuable, and are essential signs of esteem&mdash;is a relatively recent development in the history of the diamond trade. Until the late nineteenth century, diamonds were found only in a few riverbeds in India and in the jungles of Brazil, and the entire world production of gem diamonds amounted to a few pounds a year. In 1870, however, huge diamond mines were discovered near the Orange River, in South Africa, where diamonds were soon being scooped out by the ton. Suddenly, the market was deluged with diamonds. The British financiers who had organized the South African mines quickly realized that their investment was endangered; diamonds had little intrinsic value&mdash;and their price depended almost entirely on their scarcity. The financiers feared that when new mines were developed in South Africa, diamonds would become at best only semiprecious gems.&rdquo;</li>

He says everybody would be happier if we just stopped lying. Tell the truth, all the time. This would be radical enough &mdash; a world without fibs &mdash; but Blanton goes further. He says we should toss out the filters between our brains and our mouths. If you think it, say it. Confess to your boss your secret plans to start your own company. If you&rsquo;re having fantasies about your wife&rsquo;s sister, Blanton says to tell your wife and tell her sister. It&rsquo;s the only path to authentic relationships. It&rsquo;s the only way to smash through modernity&rsquo;s soul-deadening alienation. Oversharing? No such thing.&rdquo;</li>

Until the early 1970s, less than 11 percent of the adult population graduated from college, and most of them could get a decent job. Today nearly a third have college degrees, and a higher percentage of them graduated from nonelite schools. A bachelor&rsquo;s degree on its own no longer conveys intelligence and capability.&rdquo;</li>

Too often, people refuse to acknowledge trade-offs or opportunity costs (health and military spending are obvious candidates here). [...] It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of scope for &lsquo;no brainer&rsquo; policy improvements that every reasonable person should be able to agree on. But maybe I&rsquo;m missing something. So let me take a stab at outlining some of the issues where the answer seems to me completely obvious &mdash; and I hope that others will add more suggestions in the comments, and/or explain where you think I&rsquo;m going wrong.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/">Ends Don&rsquo;t Justify Means (Among Humans)</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;The end does not justify the means&rsquo; is just consequentialist reasoning at one meta-level up. If a human starts thinking on the object level that the end justifies the means, this has awful consequences given our untrustworthy brains; therefore a human shouldn&rsquo;t think this way. But it is all still ultimately consequentialism. It&rsquo;s just reflective consequentialism, for beings who know that their moment-by-moment decisions are made by untrusted hardware.&rdquo;</li>

[...] That went so far off the original topic my final reply to him follows here (in several ensuing parts). I&rsquo;m not even responding to half the insane things he said or claimed, and yet it&rsquo;s still intolerably long for most readers. But anyone interested in political philosophy as a whole, or my political philosophy in particular, will find in the following a useful toolkit for constructing a sound political philosophy from the ground up (whether they follow mine or not), by seeing where crazies like Benjamin go wrong, and avoiding what they do by doing (methodologically) exactly the opposite.&rdquo;</li>

In each case, I thought I was working for a particular goal (become capable of doing useful Singularity work, advance the cause of a political party, do useful Singularity work). But as soon as I set that goal, my brain automatically and invisibly re-interpreted it as the goal of doing something that gave the impression of doing prestigious work for a cause (spending all my waking time working, being the spokesman of a political party, writing papers or doing something else few others could do). &lsquo;Prestigious work&rsquo; could also be translated as &lsquo;work that really convinces others that you are doing something valuable for a cause&rsquo;.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-195.html">How We Won the War on Thai Chili Sauce</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Watch how it happens. Someone sees something, so he says something. The person he says it to &mdash; a policeman, a security guard, a flight attendant &mdash; now faces a choice: ignore or escalate. Even though he may believe that it&rsquo;s a false alarm, it&rsquo;s not in his best interests to dismiss the threat. If he&rsquo;s wrong, it&rsquo;ll cost him his career. But if he escalates, he&rsquo;ll be praised for &ldquo;doing his job&rdquo; and the cost will be borne by others. So he escalates. And the person he escalates to also escalates, in a series of CYA decisions.

And it&rsquo;s depressing that anyone should have to explain why this is a problem. It seems totally obvious to me. But apparently, it&rsquo;s not so obvious. So I&rsquo;m going to spell it out. When the topic of misogyny comes up, and men change the subject, it trivializes misogyny. When the topic of misogyny comes up, and men change the subject, it conveys the message that whatever men want to talk about is more important than misogyny. When the topic of misogyny comes up, and men change the subject to something that&rsquo;s about them, it conveys the message that men are the ones who really matter, and that any harm done to men is always more important than misogyny.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html">What You Can&rsquo;t Say</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing would be true no matter where you went: you&rsquo;d have to watch what you said. Opinions we consider harmless could have gotten you in big trouble. I&rsquo;ve already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big trouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century, and did get Galileo in big trouble when he said it&ndash; that the earth moves. [...] It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours were the first era to get everything just right. [...] What would someone coming back to visit us in a time machine have to be careful not to say? That&rsquo;s what I want to study here. But I want to do more than just shock everyone with the heresy du jour.

  <li><b><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/fish.html">A Fish Did Not Write This Essay</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes I have the chance to explain that I am an atheist not because I know there isn&rsquo;t a god, but because I don&rsquo;t believe there is. If someone insisted that their pet fish could talk, I really couldn&rsquo;t say I knew it didn&rsquo;t, especially if I could not go and see for myself, but it would still be fair for me to say that there are no talking fish. The relevance of this is that I do not believe god exists any more than I believe fish can talk. Certainly, I have not examined all species of fish, nor every single fish for that matter, nor could I ever accomplish such a feat, but the claim that they exist is so contrary to my own personal experience and reliable facts that I simply will not believe it unless very definitive proof is provided.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html">Dead Child Currency</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;I think dead children should be used as a unit of currency. I know this sounds controversial, but hear me out. [...] So one dead child = eight hundred dollars. If you spend eight hundred dollars on a laptop, that&rsquo;s one African kid who died because you didn&rsquo;t give it to charity. Distasteful but true. Now that we know that, we can get down to the details of designing the currency itself. It should be a big gold coin, with a picture of a smiling Burmese child on the front, and a tombstone on the back. The abbreviation can be DC.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/singer10/English">Why Pay More for Fairness?</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;What is curious about Lindsey&rsquo;s argument, however, is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends &ndash; encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price. Pro-market economists don&rsquo;t object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products. If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that&rsquo;s what James Bond prefers, economists don&rsquo;t object that the market is being distorted. So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?&rdquo;</li>

Since there is usually little you can do about the delay of a task&rsquo;s reward, we&rsquo;ll focus on the three terms of the procrastination equation over which we have some control. To beat procrastination, we need to: (1) Increase your expectancy of success. (2) Increase the task&rsquo;s value. (3) Decrease your impulsiveness. You might think these things are out of your control, but researchers have found several useful methods for achieving each of them.&rdquo;</li>

Universities that created this academic content for free must pay to read it. Step back even further. The public &mdash; which has indirectly funded this research with federal and state taxes that support our higher education system &mdash; has virtually no access to this material, since neighborhood libraries cannot afford to pay those subscription costs.

[...] This is an example of what I&rsquo;d call a Level 1 or object-level action: something that directly moves the world from a less desirable state into a more desirable state. On the other hand, suppose you take a typing class, which teaches you to type twice as fast. [...T]he typing class can still be very useful, because every Level 1 project you tackle later which involves typing will go better- you&rsquo;ll be able to do it more efficiently, and you&rsquo;ll get a higher return on your time. This is what I&rsquo;d call a Level 2 or meta-level action, because it doesn&rsquo;t make the world better directly &ndash; it makes the world better indirectly, by improving the effectiveness of Level 1 actions.

  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/uy/dark_side_epistemology/">Dark Side Epistemology</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;If you once tell a lie, the truth is ever after your enemy. [...] If you pick up a pebble from the driveway, and tell a geologist that you found it on a beach &ndash; well, do you know what a geologist knows about rocks? I don&rsquo;t. But I can suspect that a water-worn pebble wouldn&rsquo;t look like a droplet of frozen lava from a volcanic eruption. Do you know where the pebble in your driveway really came from?

  <li><b><a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2012/01/faircloths-new-atheist-strategy-pledge.html">The Pledge and the Motto</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;From the time a child enters grade school, he or she encounters a very strong anti-atheist message. The pledge of allegiance tells her that people who do not support a nation &lsquo;under God&rsquo; are to be thought of the same way as those who promote rebellion, tyranny, and injustice. If she looks at her money &ndash; when she learns to read the message printed there &ndash; she learns that if she lacks trust in God then she does not qualify as &lsquo;one of us&rsquo;. &lsquo;We&rsquo; trust in God.&rdquo;</li>

Perhaps. But adjusting for bias and groupthink is not so easy, as indicated by one of the major conclusions developed by Buturovic and sustained in our joint papers. Education had very little impact on responses, we found; survey respondents who&rsquo;d gone to college did only slightly less badly than those who hadn&rsquo;t. [...] Still, the fact that a college education showed almost no effect&mdash;at least for those inclined to take such a survey&mdash;strongly suggests that the classroom is no great corrective for myside bias.

Yet Mr. Romney portrays the president as the second coming of Fidel Castro and seems confident that he will pay no price for making stuff up. Welcome to post-truth politics. Why does Mr. Romney think he can get away with this kind of thing? Well, he has already gotten away with a series of equally fraudulent attacks.

  <li><b><a href="http://ebonmusings.org/atheism/thoughts.html">Thoughts in Captivity</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Many critics of organized religion have compared it to brainwashing or mind control. Personally, I would not describe it in these terms. These are strong words with overtly pejorative connotations, and their use is likely to be perceived by believers as an ad hominem attack, rather than contributing to a civil and productive dialogue between atheists and theists. Nevertheless, the fact remains that their application is not without merit. Even the staunchest defender of theism cannot deny that, to an extent, religions teach their followers to prize faith over facts, to rely on the word of authorities rather than their own judgment, and to disregard arguments that run counter to their beliefs.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://ebonmusings.org/atheism/gaps.html">Pay No Attention to the Deity Behind the Curtain</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;I can imagine a world where cities in heathen nations regularly exploded in flames for no apparent reason; a world where we could go to the Middle East and see the entrance to the Garden of Eden, locked and barred and guarded by a flaming sword, with misty green Paradise visible in the distance beyond the gates; a world where angels flew alongside planes blowing trumpets and calling on sinners to repent. I can imagine a world of miracles and spirits, where faith healers could cure severed spinal cords or regenerate lost limbs, where prophets called fire from heaven, sent rain, parted seas and multiplied loaves and fishes, where voices boomed from the sky in answer to prayers, and where the entire geologic record consisted of fossils randomly jumbled throughout strata of flood-deposited sediments.

They are designed to prevent any plunge into pessimism that determinism might engender among those who suppose we must have free will for life to be worth living. Fatalism is pretty obviously false, but we want to make sure no one gets demoralized by a naturalism that understands all our behavior as fully a function of environment and heredity. It&rsquo;s important (and not difficult) to avoid the false conclusion that determinism disempowers us. It doesn&rsquo;t in the least; rather it shows us how to make the most of our abilities. If after reading these, you find yourself depressed about not having free will, please be in touch.&rdquo;</li>

Otherwise you may be doomed to repeat it. See what useful principles you can learn from it, taking into account the context of the other mistakes you&rsquo;ve made.

Astrology is flatly condemned in the Bible as pagan foolishness, sinful idolatry, even the handiwork of demons. Yet according to the Gospel of Matthew, the magi learned of the baby Jesus&rsquo; existence and nature from a star! Why would demons be interested in helping people find and worship the Son of God?

  <li><b><a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2010/02/desiring-each-good.html">Desiring Each Good</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Some critics allege that the utilitarian agent has but a single desire: to maximize welfare. This would seem to embody an objectionably instrumental attitude towards individual persons. Rather than caring about each of Tom, Dick, and Harry in their own right, the utilitarian (allegedly) just cares about helping them as a constitutive means to promoting aggregate welfare. Tom serves as a faceless &lsquo;receptacle&rsquo; of utility, rather than mattering for his own sake. [...] So I think the objection ultimately fails. Even in the toughest case &mdash; that of merely possible persons, who cannot be the ultimate ground of our concern for their welfare &mdash; consequentialists can still desire each good separately, and hence refrain from treating people as fungible.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ke/illusion_of_transparency_why_no_one_understands/">Illusion of Transparency: Why No One Understands You</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;In hindsight bias, people who know the outcome of a situation believe the outcome should have been easy to predict in advance. Knowing the outcome, we reinterpret the situation in light of that outcome. Even when warned, we can&rsquo;t de-interpret to empathize with someone who doesn&rsquo;t know what we know. Closely related is the illusion of transparency: We always know what we mean by our words, and so we expect others to know it too. Reading our own writing, the intended interpretation falls easily into place, guided by our knowledge of what we really meant. It&rsquo;s hard to empathize with someone who must interpret blindly, guided only by the words.&rdquo;</li>

Publicly state that this issue (pick something&mdash;abiogenesis or the cause of the Big Bang or fine tuning or whatever) is the hill that you will fight to the death on. Man up, commit to it, and impose consequences. Say, &lsquo;I publicly declare that God must be the resolution to this question. A scientific consensus will never find me wrong or else I will drop my faith.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/11/25/ask-chris-81-scooby-doo-and-secular-humanism">Ask Chris #81: Scooby-Doo and Secular Humanism</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;I will fight tooth and nail over the idea that there should never, ever be even a trace of the supernatural in the world of Scooby-Doo. And as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it&#39;s not a matter of preference, either &mdash; it&rsquo;s so deeply ingrained into the premise of the show and the way the characters interact that if actual monsters do show up, the whole thing collapses.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/90n/summary_of_the_straw_vulcan/">Summary of &ldquo;The Straw Vulcan&rdquo;</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;The classic Hollywood example of rationality is the Vulcans from Star Trek. They are depicted as an ultra-rational race that has eschewed all emotion from their lives. But is this truly rational? [...] These characters have a sort of fake rationality. They don&rsquo;t fail because rationality failed, but because they aren&rsquo;t actually being rational. Straw Vulcan rationality is not the same thing as actual rationality.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/02/03/you-will-never-kill-piracy-and-piracy-will-never-kill-you/">You Will Never Kill Piracy, and Piracy Will Never Kill You</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Now that the SOPA and PIPA fights have died down, and Hollywood prepares their next salvo against internet freedom with ACTA and PCIP, it&rsquo;s worth pausing to consider how the war on piracy could actually be won. It can&rsquo;t, is the short answer, and one these companies do not want to hear as they put their fingers in their ears and start yelling.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2005/06/universal-basic-income.html">Universal Basic Income</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Should the state provide a baseline income to all adult citizens? It need not be a lot &ndash; though it could be &ndash; but even a few thousand dollars a year would surely help many of the less fortunate in our society. I think it is a much better idea than targeted (non-universal) welfare benefits, for several reasons.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/singer70/English">Sticking to It</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Human decision-making is complex. On our own, our tendency to yield to short-term temptations, and even to addictions, may be too strong for our rational, long-term planning. But when the temptations are not immediately present, we can erect barriers to them that make us less likely to succumb when they return. Knowing that we can control our own behavior makes it more likely that we will.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.spencergreenberg.com/2011/11/knowing-why-we-act/">Knowing Why We Act</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;A stranger asks you on a date, or asks you to dance at a club. Presumably your decision of whether to agree might depend on how good-looking you think the person is. But what other, subtler factors, might influence your decision? It turns out that a powerfully influential factor in these cases is whether the person gives you a brief touch on the upper arm when making their request.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/">The Second Law of Thermodynamics, and Engines of Cognition</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;And conversely, one subsystem cannot increase in mutual information with another subsystem, without (a) interacting with it and (b) doing thermodynamic work. Otherwise you could build a Maxwell&rsquo;s Demon and violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics &ndash; which in turn would violate Liouville&rsquo;s Theorem &ndash; which is prohibited in the standard model of physics. Which is to say: To form accurate beliefs about something, you really do have to observe it. It&rsquo;s a very physical, very real process: any rational mind does &ldquo;work&rdquo; in the thermodynamic sense, not just the sense of mental effort.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://realevang.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/xfiles-reasons-and-rationalizations/">XFiles: Reasons and rationalizations</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;How do you account for the existence of suffering? Well, maybe God has a good reason for it. Ok, what good reason? Well, think of something God might be trying to do. If you can think of something, then that&rsquo;s a reason. But it might not be a good reason. So how can you be sure God&rsquo;s reasons are good? Well, what&rsquo;s He trying to do? If it&rsquo;s a good thing, then that makes the reason a good reason (aka &ldquo;the end justifies the means&rdquo;). Right? So maybe suffering exists because God wants us to get to know Him, because knowledge of God is the greatest possible joy and satisfaction for mankind, even if it doesn&rsquo;t happen until after we die. Since maximum happiness and satisfaction are good, that means God has a good reason for allowing suffering.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2011/12/religious-liberty.html">Religious Liberty</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;These organizations say that anything that can be defined as a &lsquo;religious practice&rsquo; &ndash; even if it is hurtful or harmful to the interests of those who are not members of that religion &ndash; must be respected by the government. Since attacking infidels fits this definition, the logical conclusion that this religious practice must be provided with constitutional protections.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html">Why There Aren&rsquo;t More Googles</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;From the evidence I&rsquo;ve seen so far, startups that turn down acquisition offers usually end up doing better. Not always, but usually there&rsquo;s a bigger offer coming, or perhaps even an IPO. Of course, the reason startups do better when they turn down acquisition offers is not necessarily that all such offers undervalue startups. More likely the reason is that the kind of founders who have the balls to turn down a big offer also tend to be very successful. That spirit is exactly what you want in a startup.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/david_damberger_what_happens_when_an_ngo_admits_failure.html">David Damberger &ndash; What happens when an NGO admits failure&nbsp;[TED Talk]</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;International aid groups make the same mistakes over and over again. At TEDxYYC David Damberger uses his own engineering failure in India to call for the development sector to publicly admit, analyze, and learn from their missteps. David Damberger&rsquo;s work with Engineers Without Borders has taken him from communities in India to Southern Africa where he ran development and infrastructure programs.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://givewell.org/giving101">Givewell&rsquo;s Giving 101</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Your donation can change someone&rsquo;s life. For a few thousand dollars you can literally save someone&rsquo;s life in the developing world. For around $15,000 you can reduce the chance that a child born today in the United States ends up in prison. These claims aren&rsquo;t normal &lsquo;marketing pitches&rsquo; you read in direct mail solicitations &mdash; these are the results that the top 1% of charities we&rsquo;ve looked at achieve &mdash; and you can count on them.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2008/10/27/faith-as-a-last-resort/">Faith as a Last Resort</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;So why should you need faith to believe in God? I know that seems like a dumb-ass question. But hear me out. Why should there be a real, enormously powerful entity in the world, an entity with a more real and more powerful effect on the world than anything else&hellip; and yet, for this entity and this entity only, in order to fully understand and believe in its existence, the most essential requirement is that we want to believe?&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/opinion/keynes-was-right.html">Keynes Was Right</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;The bottom line is that 2011 was a year in which our political elite obsessed over short-term deficits that aren&rsquo;t actually a problem and, in the process, made the real problem &mdash; a depressed economy and mass unemployment &mdash; worse. The good news, such as it is, is that President Obama has finally gone back to fighting against premature austerity &mdash; and he seems to be winning the political battle. And one of these years we might actually end up taking Keynes&rsquo;s advice, which is every bit as valid now as it was 75 years ago.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2006/03/a-mile-wide-and-an-inch-deep/">A Mile Wide and an Inch Deep</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Only four in ten Americans can name more than four of the Ten Commandments. Astonishingly, even to me, only half can name even one of the four gospels. 12% of Americans &ndash; which is something in excess of thirty million people &ndash; believe that Joan of Arc was Noah&rsquo;s wife. And finally, three-quarters of Americans &ndash; very nearly the nation&rsquo;s entire Christian population &ndash; believe that the Bible teaches that &ldquo;God helps those who help themselves&rdquo;. This maxim was actually uttered by Benjamin Franklin, and appears nowhere in scripture.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2008/05/tax-and-redistribute.html">Tax and Redistribute</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Really, this should be a no-brainer. And note that the lesson generalizes. Whenever someone complains that an economic disincentive &ldquo;unfairly burdens the poor&rdquo;, the solution is to redistribute the proceeds. (Example: worried that gas taxes are a burden to the poor? Solution: redistribute the proceeds. The poor will profit, as will the environment.) Why is this not common knowledge?&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://alexvermeer.com/various-forms-of-atheism/">Various Forms of Atheism</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;The word atheist has different meanings in different contexts, so we need to unpack it if we want to use the word in productive discussion. Greg Epstein in his book good without God quotes an excellent paragraph from Sherwin Wine, who separates atheism into several distinct intellectual categories, as follows&rdquo; (By these categories, I&rsquo;m personally an ontological, ethical, existential, and potentially ignostic atheist.)</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/08/why-we-should-use-odds-all-time.html">Why We Should Use Odds All the Time</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;One of the more beautiful things to discover in this world is that there are objective rules for the manipulation of subjective certainties and uncertainties. Bayesian statisticians call these levels of uncertainty &lsquo;probabilities.&rsquo; (Frequentists&hellip; get confused at this point, on which I hope to write much more in the future). One of the most unexpected beneficial side-effects of thinking probabilistically as a habit, is that it makes you realize just how much you actually know. (This is probably the one skeptical conclusion that doesn&rsquo;t deflate one&rsquo;s ego.)&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure.html">Paul Bloom &ndash; The Origins of Pleasure</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Why do we like an original painting better than a forgery? Psychologist Paul Bloom argues that human beings are essentialists &mdash; that our beliefs about the history of an object change how we experience it, not simply as an illusion, but as a deep feature of what pleasure (and pain) is.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.raikoth.net/libertarian.html">The Non-Libertarian FAQ (aka Why I Hate Your Freedom)</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;But the Internet, especially the parts of it where people debate politics, are full of libertarians. Some areas are downright dominated by them. And I see very few attempts to provide a complete critique of libertarian philosophy. There are a bunch of ad hoc critiques of specific positions: people arguing for socialist health care, people in favor of gun control. But one of the things that draws people to libertarianism is that it is a unified, harmonious system. Unlike the mix-and-match philosophies of the Democratic and Republican parties, libertarianism is coherent and sometimes even derived from first principles. The only way to convincingly talk someone out of libertarianism is to launch a challenge on the entire system.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140501163928/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5sk/inferring_our_desires/">Inferring Our Desires</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;The idea that we lack good introspective access to our own desires &ndash; that we often have no idea what we want2 &ndash; is a key lemma in naturalistic metaethics, so it seems worth a post to collect the science by which we know that.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/9jh/the_humans_hidden_utility_function_maybe/">The Human&rsquo;s Hidden Utility Function (Maybe)</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Suppose it turned out that humans violate the axioms of VNM rationality (and therefore don&rsquo;t act like they have utility functions) because there are three valuation systems in the brain that make conflicting valuations, and all three systems contribute to choice. And suppose that upon reflection we would clearly reject the outputs of two of these systems, whereas the third system looks something more like a utility function we might be able to use[...] What I just described is part of the leading theory of choice in the human brain.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/michael_martin/xtianity_absurd.html">Is Christianity Absurd?</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;For the purpose of my argument I will understand Christianity to mean the religious view that is characterized by doctrines such as Salvation through Christ, Heaven, the Atonement, the ethical views of Jesus, and belief in God. So understood is Christianity absurd? This question is seldom asked, let alone answered. I will argue that a plausible case can be made for the claim that Christianity is absurd in an important sense of that term. In what follows I will not so much present new arguments as deploy standard atheistic ones in new ways.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2009/11/30/creating-god-in-ones-own-image/">Creating God in One&rsquo;s Own Image</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;For many religious people, the popular question &lsquo;What would Jesus do?&rsquo; is essentially the same as &lsquo;What would I do?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the message from an intriguing and controversial new study by Nicholas Epley from the University of Chicago. Through a combination of surveys, psychological manipulation and brain-scanning, he has found that when religious Americans try to infer the will of God, they mainly draw on their own personal beliefs.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://atheistethicist.blogspot.com/2012/01/2012-campaign-year.html">2012 &ndash; A Campaign Year</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say you came to me wanting me to support gay marriage. Let&rsquo;s say that I agree with you on all of the points of evidence and reason &ndash; that the laws are discriminatory and unjust &ndash; perhaps even that these restrictions on gay marriage violate the principles on which the Constitution was founded. However, knowing my district, I know that voting for gay marriage would mean a sizable shift in campaign contributions and votes to my opponent &ndash; a bible thumping young-earth prayer-in-school creationist. [...] What you are asking me to do is, in practical terms, no different than asking me to resign my position and appoint the bible thumping young-earth prayer-in-school creationist in my place. Is that really what you want me to do? [...] Then you need to bring money and votes to the table.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth">The Simple Truth</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;This essay is meant to restore a naive view of truth. [...] Many people, so questioned, don&rsquo;t know how to answer in exquisitely rigorous detail. Nonetheless they would not be wise to abandon the concept of &lsquo;truth&rsquo;. There was a time when no one knew the equations of gravity in exquisitely rigorous detail, yet if you walked off a cliff, you would fall.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101230011609/http://www.daylightatheism.org/2009/03/free-will-and-evil.html">Free Will and Evil</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Namely, an abiding puzzle for Christian theology is why, if God hates evil and sin so much, he created a world that would guarantee the production of massive quantities of it. As I&rsquo;ve written in the past, free will is not a mathematical point, nor is it a simple binary choice between good and evil. Free will is a complex bundle of desires, habits and predispositions, any of which can be altered or taken away. Even if we grant the premise that free will is necessary for a world of meaningful choice, why wouldn&rsquo;t God create human beings with inclinations toward virtue, so that few people exercise the evil options that are theoretically open to them? The reality of our world seems rather to be the opposite.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/8f0/existential_risk/">Existential Risk</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Our technology gives us great power. If we can avoid using this power to destroy ourselves, then we can use it to spread throughout the galaxy and create structures and experiences of value on an unprecedented scale. Reducing existential risk &mdash; that is, carefully and thoughtfully preparing to not kill ourselves &mdash; may be the greatest moral imperative we have.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/singer83/English">Peter Singer on The Ethics of Internet Piracy</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Last year, I told a colleague that I would include Internet ethics in a course that I was teaching. She suggested that I read a recently published anthology on computer ethics &ndash; and attached the entire volume to the email. Should I have refused to read a pirated book? Was I receiving stolen goods, as advocates of stricter laws against Internet piracy claim?&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/11/does-altruism-actually-exist/248074/">Does Altruism Actually Exist?</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Some have argued that all acts of kindness are made with an ulterior motive, but new research suggests that there is a link between fairness and altruism, and it develops very early.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.philosophyetc.net/2005/03/good-to-good-for.html">Good To &amp; Good For</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Regular readers will know that my theory of welfare is that our individual good consists in objective desire fulfillment. What matters is whether the world really is the way we desire it to be, not whether we merely believe it (and so are happy). The linked post supports this claim by appeal to thought experiments where we would prefer to be mistakenly sad rather than mistakenly happy.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/48/the_power_of_positivist_thinking/">The Power of Positivist Thinking</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Call me non-conformist, call me one man against the world, but&hellip;I kinda like logical positivism. [...] Positivism became stricter and stricter, defining more and more things as meaningless, until someone finally pointed out that positivism itself was meaningless by the positivists&rsquo; definitions, at which point the entire system vanished in a puff of logic. [...] But if we&rsquo;ve learned anything from fantasy books, it is that any cabal of ancient wise men destroyed by their own hubris at the height of their glory must leave behind a single ridiculously powerful artifact, which in the right hands gains the power to dispel darkness and annihilate the forces of evil. The positivists left us the idea of verifiability, and it&rsquo;s time we started using it more&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/four-keys-to-a-better-tax-system-economic-view.html">A Better Tax System (Assembly Instructions Included)</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that time again. Start filing all those W-2s, 1099s and scraps of paper you&rsquo;ll need for your annual tax return. No doubt, this isn&rsquo;t your favorite activity. At some point, you may ask yourself whether there&rsquo;s a better way. There is. Economists who study public finance have long agreed with William E. Simon, the former Treasury secretary, who said that &lsquo;the nation should have a tax system that looks like someone designed it on purpose.&rsquo; Here are four principles of tax reform that most of those economists would endorse:&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/">A Fable of Science and Politics</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;The conflict has not vanished. Society is still divided along Blue and Green lines, and there is a &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Green&rdquo; position on almost every contemporary issue of political or cultural importance. The Blues advocate taxes on individual incomes, the Greens advocate taxes on merchant sales; the Blues advocate stricter marriage laws, while the Greens wish to make it easier to obtain divorces; the Blues take their support from the heart of city areas, while the more distant farmers and watersellers tend to be Green; the Blues believe that the Earth is a huge spherical rock at the center of the universe, the Greens that it is a huge flat rock circling some other object called a Sun.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/aid/heuristics_and_biases_in_charity/">Heuristics and Biases in Charity</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;So diversification and scope insensitivity are two biases that people have, and which affect charitable giving. What others are there? According to Baron &amp; Szymanska (2010), there are a number of heuristics involved in giving that lead to various biases. Diversification we are already familiar with. The others are Evaluability, Average vs. Marginal Benefit, Prominence, Identifiability, and Voluntary vs. Tax.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502044127/http://www.naturalism.org/Heritage%20Christian.htm">Correspondence on Naturalism with Christian Heritage School</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Below is correspondence on naturalism from the sophomore and senior worldview classes at Christian Heritage School in Hillsboro, Oregon. [...] The students raise interesting, well-formulated questions that anyone considering naturalism as a worldview would want answered. The replies therefore cover some central concerns about naturalism such as its internal coherence, the naturalist&rsquo;s commitment to empiricism, naturalistic metaphysics, and the naturalistic basis for morality.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/">Outside the Laboratory</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Suppose we have an apparently competent scientist, who knows how to design an experiment on N subjects; the N subjects will receive a randomized treatment; blinded judges will classify the subject outcomes; and then we&rsquo;ll run the results through a computer and see if the results are significant at the 0.05 confidence level. Now this is not just a ritualized tradition. This is not a point of arbitrary etiquette like using the correct fork for salad. It is a ritualized tradition for testing hypotheses experimentally. Why should you test your hypothesis experimentally? Because you know the journal will demand so before it publishes your paper? Because you were trained to do it in college? Because everyone else says in unison that it&rsquo;s important to do the experiment, and they&rsquo;ll look at you funny if you say otherwise?&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121015012050/http://www.naturalism.org/landscape.htm">Worldview Naturalism: A Status Report</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;What follows is first an overview of naturalism and its implications, then a look at its connection to atheism and humanism, and then discussion of some differences between naturalism and anti-naturalism in assumptions and conclusions. Highlighting these differences can help make the choice between worldviews easier for the undecided. Of course your worldview may not be what matters most; after all, people live quite happily without giving much thought to the big questions. But if you&rsquo;re curious about what it is to be human here in the cosmos, caught up in a situation you certainly didn&rsquo;t ask for, your worldview can open, or close off, some avenues of exploration.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/reppert.html">Critical Review of Victor Reppert&rsquo;s Defense of the Argument from Reason</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Victor Reppert has contributed what is surely the most extensive defense of the so-called &lsquo;Argument from Reason&rsquo; yet to appear in print, despite its many (and serious) failings. In a nutshell, an argument from reason argues from &lsquo;the existence of rational thought&rsquo; to the necessity of theism and the nonphysicality of the human mind, such that &lsquo;our very thinking&rsquo; can &lsquo;provide evidence that theism is true&rsquo;. In this critique I will not address every scientific and philosophic objection one could raise against Reppert&rsquo;s case. Rather, I will point out what I believe are the most important conceptual flaws in his arguments, and explain in detail how his arguments are ineffective against my own personal worldview.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/dan_gilbert_researches_happiness.html">Dan Gilbert on Our Mistaken Expectations&nbsp;[TED Talk]</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Dan Gilbert presents research and data from his exploration of happiness &mdash; sharing some surprising tests and experiments that you can also try on yourself.&rdquo; This talk presents a lot of data that demonstrates that making decisions is more about not knowing how to get what we want &mdash; we don&rsquo;t even know what it is we want!</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/s6/probability_is_subjectively_objective/">Probability is Subjectively Objective</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Your &lsquo;probability that the ten trillionth decimal digit of pi is 4&prime;, is an attribute of yourself, and exists in your mind; the real digit is either 4 or not. And if you could change your belief about the probability by editing your brain, you wouldn&rsquo;t expect that to change the probability. Therefore I say of probability that it is &lsquo;subjectively objective&rsquo;.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2012/03/01/truth-is-not-boring/">Truth is Not Boring</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;I am far more in alliance with a religious believer who cares passionately about the truth, who genuinely wants to understand the truth, who sincerely believes that God is real and is carefully investigating that question to arrive at a better understanding of the truth, than I am with an atheist who thinks truth is boring. I think that this believer, if they genuinely care about and pursue the truth, will eventually reach the conclusion of atheism. But I am more allied with them, in their sincere pursuit of the truth, than I am with an atheist who thinks truth is boring&hellip; and who issues an ill-informed lecture chiding other atheists for being so naive as to care about it.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/15/an-essential-question-that-no-one-is-asking-charities/">An Essential Question That No One is Asking Charities</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;If a charity demonstrates that its core program has changed lives in the past, is likely to change lives in the future, and gets great &lsquo;bang for your buck,&rsquo; is this enough reason to donate to it? We say no. The missing piece: Will more funding lead to more of the good program(s)? We generally call this the &lsquo;room for more funding&rsquo; question, and we&rsquo;ve seen next to no helpful discussion of the issue within academia, within the nonprofit sector, or anywhere else.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/nm/disguised_queries/">Disguised Queries</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;How can reality vary with the meaning of a word? The points in thingspace don&rsquo;t move around when we redraw a boundary. But people often don&rsquo;t realize that their argument about where to draw a definitional boundary, is really a dispute over whether to infer a characteristic shared by most things inside an empirical cluster&hellip; Hence the phrase, &lsquo;disguised query&rsquo;..&rdquo;</li>

[...]But why do I think C.E. and B.C.E. are dumb? [...] Calling the sixth day of the week &lsquo;Saturday&rsquo; (literally &ldquo;Saturn&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;) does not entail embracing a Eurocentric worldview or belief in the God Saturn. It&rsquo;s just using the English language. So, too, the labels B.C. and A.D.&rdquo;</li>

A metaphysical hypothesis might make a claim about the reality that underlies physics itself. Alternatively, it might say something about the nature of our minds, or the creation of our world. I think the Matrix Hypothesis should be regarded as a metaphysical hypothesis with all three of these elements. It makes a claim about the reality underlying physics, about the nature of our minds, and about the creation of the world.&rdquo;</li>

So my advice is to spend a while really noticing that tradeoff. Notice whether you really do value the milkshake more than a child&rsquo;s vaccination.

This provides the basis for the analysis in the second section of the functioning of a national monetary system. Finally, we show how this knowledge can be used to construct a public service program (PSE) that guarantees true, full employment with price and currency stability.&rdquo;</li>

Nearly 16 million people can&rsquo;t find jobs even, though we are constantly being told that the worst recession since the Great Depression has officially ended. Yet instead of trying to revive the productive economy, most of the Obama administration&rsquo;s recovery efforts still remain focused on cardio-shock treatment for Wall Street. [...] We therefore suggest a new approach: Government as Employer of Last Resort (ELR). The U.S. Government can proceed directly to zero unemployment by hiring all of the labor that cannot find private sector employment. Furthermore, by fixing the wage paid under this ELR program at a level that does not disrupt existing labor markets, i.e., a wage level close to the existing minimum wage, substantive price stability can be expected.&rdquo;</li>

Nobody can argue with &ldquo;only five minutes&rdquo;&mdash;including your brain&mdash;so it lets you have it. Of course, what then usually happens is five minutes into your task, you really start to get into it.

Under one president, real per capita government spending at that point was 14.4 percent higher than four years previously; under the other, less than half as much, just 6.4 percent.

I have two thoughts to add. First, the Death Star is a bit misunderstood. It is primarily a tool of domestic politics rather than warfare, and should be compared to alternative means of suppressing the population of a galaxy. Second, as a weapon of war, it should be compared to alternative uses of scarce defense resources. Understood properly, the Death Star is not worth it.&rdquo;</li>

We don&rsquo;t understand exactly how this works &mdash; humanity is very much in the early stages of figuring out consciousness &mdash; but an overwhelming body of evidence strongly points to that conclusion, and atheists understand and accept that. Whatever consciousness is, it is almost certainly a construct of the brain. And we think social experiences, such as morality, virtue, love, grief, are emotions and mental constructs, which evolved in us to help us survive and flourish as a social species.

Most notably, what we got was a test of demand-side versus supply-side stories about the nature of depressions. [...] How could you tell which story was right? One answer was to look at the behavior of interest rates; the other was to look at inflation. For if you believed a demand-side story, you would also believe that even a large monetary expansion would have little inflationary effect; if you believed a supply-side story, you would expect lots of inflation from too much money chasing a reduced supply of goods. And indeed, people on the right have been forecasting runaway inflation for years now. Yet the predicted inflation keeps not coming.&rdquo;</li>

Religious persecution was common in previous centuries, and still occurs in some countries today. But prohibiting the ritual slaughter of animals does not stop Jews or Muslims from practicing their religion. [...] Neither Islam nor Judaism upholds a requirement to eat meat. [...] Restricting the legitimate defense of religious freedom to rejecting proposals that stop people from practicing their religion makes it possible to resolve many other disputes in which it is claimed that freedom of religion is at stake. For example, allowing men and women to sit in any part of a bus does not violate orthodox Jews&rsquo; religious freedom, because Jewish law does not command that one use public transport. It&rsquo;s just a convenience that one can do without &ndash; and orthodox Jews can hardly believe that the laws to which they adhere were intended to make life maximally convenient. Likewise, the Obama administration&rsquo;s requirement to provide health insurance that covers contraception does not prevent Catholics from practicing their religion.

Responsibility enters the system when the causal chain flows through an agent &mdash; through one&rsquo;s character, values, and practical reasoning. Incompatibilists object to this: &lsquo;how can you be responsible for your actions if you weren&rsquo;t responsible for the upstream causes which determined your cognitive functioning (character, etc.) in the first place?&rsquo; They claim, in short, that responsibility requires ultimate responsibility.

How it works is that someone will be trying to solve a problem they have, say a lack of confidence around other people. They&rsquo;ll come across a piece of advice or a motivational snippet that will lead them have an epiphany or a profound realization. This often happens when someone is reading self-help books or articles. [...] The problem with these epiphanies is that they can make you feel really charged up, and like something has clicked into place in your mind, and that your life will be different from now on. They usually don&rsquo;t lead to any tangible results though. You walk around for a day or two feeling ready to take on the world, but you don&rsquo;t act any differently, and the &lsquo;high&rsquo; soon wears off.&rdquo;</li>

Associated with this problem is another, which has also been given considerable attention &ndash; the question of how morality is to be defined. The two issues are linked, since some definitions of morality allow us to move from statements of fact to moral judgments, while others do not. In this article I shall take the two issues together, and try to show that they do not merit the amount of attention they have been given. I shall argue that the differences between the contending parties are terminological, and that there are various possible terminologies, none of which has, on balance, any great advantage over any other terminology. So instead of continuing to regard these issues as central, moral philosophers could, I believe, &lsquo;agree to disagree&rsquo; about the &lsquo;is-ought&rsquo; problem, and about the definition of morality, provided only that everyone was careful to stipulate how he was using the term &lsquo;moral&rsquo; and was aware of the implications and limitations of the definition he was using.

Even setting aside the harm that smokers inflict on nonsmokers, the free-to-choose argument is unconvincing with a drug as highly addictive as tobacco, and it becomes even more dubious when we consider that most smokers take up the habit as teenagers and later want to quit.

Why did the president repeat this in his Sept. 20 Univision appearance and then dwell on the anti-Muslim videoat the United Nations?

So if everyone worked in (say) construction, we&rsquo;d all starve; but that obviously doesn&rsquo;t make working in the construction sector immoral. Even if construction work is widely regarded as permissible, there is no risk of everyone doing it, and hence no risk of disaster. Similarly for choosing not to have children.

In the same way, talking about a 1/125,000 or 0.000008 risk of death associated with a hang-gliding flight is rather awkward. With that in mind. Howard coined the term &lsquo;microprobability&rsquo; (&mu;p) to refer to an event with a chance of 1 in 1 million and a 1 in 1 million chance of death he calls a &lsquo;micromort&rsquo; (&mu;mt).

Because she went out, slipped on the ice, and broke her hip. That satisfies people. It satisfies, but it wouldn&rsquo;t satisfy someone who came from another planet and who knew nothing about why when you break your hip do you go to the hospital. How do you get to the hospital when the hip is broken? Well, because her husband, seeing that her hip was broken, called the hospital up and sent somebody to get her. All that is understood by people. And when you explain a why, you have to be in some framework that you allow something to be true. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re perpetually asking why.&rdquo;</li>

Fish caught in nets by trawlers are dumped on board the ship and allowed to suffocate. Impaling live bait on hooks is a common commercial practice: long-line fishing, for example, uses hundreds or even thousands of hooks on a single line that may be 50-100km long.

There&rsquo;s a lot of psychology research on happiness that could be really useful, but people don&rsquo;t seem to be aware of it or at least aren&rsquo;t applying it.

But there is skepticism over the effectiveness of this, highlighted by phrases like &ldquo;shirking from home&rdquo;.

Call center employees who volunteered to work from home were randomized by even/odd birth-date in a 9-month experiment of working at home or in the office. We find a 12% increase in performance from home-working, of which 8.5% is from working more minutes of per shift (fewer breaks and sick-days) and 3.5% from higher performance per minute (quieter working environment). We find no negative spillovers onto workers left in the office. Home workers also reported substantially higher work satisfaction and psychological attitude scores, and their job attrition rates fell by 50%. Despite this ex post success, the impact of home-working was ex ante unclear to the firm, which is why it ran the experiment. Employees were also ex ante uncertain, with one half of employees changing their minds on home working after the experiment. This highlights how the impact of new management practices are unclear to both firms and employees.&rdquo;</li>

In chapter 4, &lsquo;Poverty as Capability Deprivation,&rsquo; Sen argues that poverty is often narrowly construed as a lack of income. This definition, however, fails to encapsulate the fact that someone can be impoverished even with financial resources. One example he uses to explain this is that of unemployment. Even if someone is able to be recouped the financial loss caused by unemployment, not being able to sustain one&rsquo;s self through employment shows a certain poverty of dignity that most would not want to subject themselves to. This is evidenced by the uneasiness we have when unemployed and being stuck with the question &lsquo;well, what do you do?&rsquo; in social situations. Poverty is not only a lack of financial resources, but is more broadly a lack of capabilities to fulfill basic human needs.&rdquo;</li>

Second, I draw on principles of moral psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary theory to explain why moral realism appears to be true even though it is not. I then argue, based on the picture of moral psychology developed herein, that realist moral language and thought promotes misunderstanding and exacerbates conflict. I consider a number of standard views concerning the practical implications of moral anti-realism and reject them.

But there are many possible reasons for voting. Some people vote because they enjoy it, and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not. Others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not assess the rationality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one&rsquo;s own ballot. [...] If these considerations fail to get people to the polls, however, compulsory voting is one way of overcoming the free-rider problem.

Collectively, their votes shape public policy. Yet an individual legislator knows that her vote will seldom decide the fate of a given bill. It will however contribute to the shaping of her image. Given that the individual Member of Congress controls his vote but does not control the outcome of legislative battles, he often has reason to vote based on how he would like to be seen. Often the positions a legislator wants to be seen to support and the policy outcomes he favors are closely aligned. Yet when the two diverge he has political reason to vote for what he wants to be seen to favor, rather than the legislative outcome actually he favors. This is especially so, Mayhew argues, because legislators are usually judged on the basis of the positions they take, not on policy outcomes.&rdquo;</li>

A certain number of bees are undeniably killed by honey production, but far more insects are killed, for example, in sugar production. And if we really cared about bugs we would never again eat anything either at home or in a restaurant that wasn&rsquo;t strictly organically grown&mdash;after all, killing bugs is what pesticides do best. [...] Our position on honey therefore just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, and I think the general population knows this on an intuitive level. Veganism for them, then, becomes more about some quasi-religious personal purity, rather than about stopping animal abuse. No wonder veganism can seem nonsensical to the average person.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/opinion/kristof-a-failed-experiment.html">A Failed Experiment</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how things often work in America. Half-a-century of tax cuts focused on the wealthiest Americans leave us with third-rate public services, leading the wealthy to develop inefficient private workarounds. It&rsquo;s manifestly silly (and highly polluting) for every fine home to have a generator. It would make more sense to invest those resources in the electrical grid so that it wouldn&rsquo;t fail in the first place. But our political system is dysfunctional: in addressing income inequality, in confronting climate change and in maintaining national infrastructure.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/fc3/checklist_of_rationality_habits/">Checklist of Rationality Habits</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;As you may know, the Center for Applied Rationality has run several workshops, each teaching content similar to that in the core sequences, but made more practical, and more into fine-grained habits. Below is the checklist of rationality habits we have been using in the minicamps&rsquo; opening session. It was co-written by Eliezer, myself, and a number of others at CFAR. As mentioned below, the goal is not to assess how &ldquo;rational&rdquo; you are, but, rather, to develop a personal shopping list of habits to consider developing. We generated it by asking ourselves, not what rationality content it&rsquo;s useful to understand, but what rationality-related actions (or thinking habits) it&rsquo;s useful to actually do. I hope you find it useful; I certainly have.&rdquo;</li>

A story has gradually developed that pins this gap on redistricting, since Republicans controlled the line-drawing process more often than not this time around. [...] We have looked at this question several times before and concluded that redistricting is a wash. [...] Democrats do gain more seats under this simulation&mdash;seven more total&mdash;but fall far short of matching their predicted vote share. The point should be clear: even under the most generous assumptions, redistricting explains less than half the gap between vote share and seat share this election cycle.&rdquo;</li>

A scientific culture that consistently produced direct replications of important results would be one that eventually purged itself of many of the problems people having been worrying about lately, including questionable research practices, p-hacking, and even data fraud. But, as I also mentioned in my previous post, this is obviously not happening. Many observers have commented on the institutional factors that discourage the conduct and, even more, the publication of replication studies.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49622942">How to Fix the Gas Shortage: Let &rsquo;em Gouge</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Gas is a good that is extremely susceptible to the temptation to hoard. It doesn&rsquo;t go bad under any reasonable period of time, which means that there&rsquo;s no penalty for purchasing excess stock in a time of shortage. The only way to discourage this is by explicit rationing or by allowing the price to increase, making people pay a higher price during the shortage. [...] There&rsquo;s good reason for the widespread condemnation of anti-gouging laws: they are&mdash;almost&mdash;universally harmful. There&rsquo;s no public good or special interest benefited by the laws. And especially when it comes to necessities like gasoline, the harm they do is sharply felt by a large part of the population. So why do we have these stupid laws at all?&rdquo;</li>

I think I have at least a 3-step theory of mind; when I read that RationalWiki article I immediately thought &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not right, the creationists probably believe they can support their own arguments&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible to have an unlimited-step theory of mind. I expect it is: I don&rsquo;t think more steps take more processing power past a certain point, just willingness to resist the temptation to be uncharitable. I think if someone did have an unlimited-step theory of mind, the way it would feel from the inside is that they and their worthier opponents have pretty much the same base-level mental algorithms all the time, but their opponents just consistently have worse epistemic luck.&rdquo;</li>

You&rsquo;re considering two charities: one that trains seeing eye dogs, another that performs cataract surgeries. You check Charity Navigator and find that they have roughly similar overhead expenses, and neither looks like a scam, so does it matter which one you pick? It turns out it matters a lot. By the charities&rsquo; numbers, a guide dog is very expensive (~$50,000) while cataract surgery is much cheaper (~$25). Assuming you think curing blindness in one eye is about as good as providing a seeing eye dog and training someone to use it, a donation of $200,000 to a seeing eye dog foundation is equivalent to donating $100 to a third world cataract charity: each helps four people.&rdquo;</li>

It seems as if the human race is ready to throw itself over a cliff. [...] Climate change, nuclear weapons, deadly viruses, crashing markets, poverty and intolerance (to name a few) do not lend themselves to the kinds of solutions that this bossy, ancient brain, which runs most of our lives, can even understand. [...] The only conclusion is that we&rsquo;re not in our right minds &mdash; which appears to be true. The two books considered in this review may not have an obvious relationship. Fred Guterl&rsquo;s The Fate of the Species: Why the Human Race May Cause Its Own Extinction and How We Can Stop It, tells a compelling if disturbing narrative of what went wrong, with great stories, clear explanations and just enough optimism to think we might make it after all. But his book, by design I think, doesn&rsquo;t deal with the biggest danger of all: the very nature of human thought. Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s Thinking Fast and Slow deals with the very nature of thought, and it just may be the most important book I&rsquo;ve read in many years. Kahneman, a Nobel Laureate in Economics, offers potential solutions that actually might work. In tandem, the books provide a useful map of where the dragons lie and also potential paths to safety.&rdquo;</li>

(All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt!)</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;In the history of foreign aid, it looked pretty harmless: a young Florida businessman decided to collect a million shirts and send them to poor people in Africa. Jason Sadler just wanted to help. He thought he&rsquo;d start with all the leftover T-shirts from his advertising company, I Wear Your Shirt. But judging by the response Sadler got from a group of foreign aid bloggers, you&rsquo;d think he wanted to toss squirrels into wood chippers or steal lunch boxes from fourth-graders. [...] Little did Sadler know he had stumbled into a debate that is raging in the aid world about the best and worst ways to deliver charity, or whether to give at all. He crashed up against a rather simple theory that returned to prominence after aid failures following the 2004 Asian tsunami and 2010 Haiti earthquake: wanting to do something to help is no excuse for not knowing the consequences of what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-04-03">Replaceability &ndash; Thinking on the Margin</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Consider a surgeon: how many lives does she save in her career? Perhaps she does 6-9 surgeries per week of which 2 are life-saving, working 45 weeks per year from age 25 to 70. Multiplying up we get 4000 life-saving surgeries. This is pretty good: to get similar results by giving to GiveWell&rsquo;s current top charity you&rsquo;d need to donate $200,000 every year for forty years. But let&rsquo;s imagine she gets sick of the job and retires early, at 47. What happens to the people that she would have been operating on? The other doctors work somewhat more to keep the operating room staffed while the hospital hires a replacement. The 2,000 lives she would have saved in the remainder of her career end up being saved by other surgeons.&rdquo;</li>

GiveWell spoke with Michael Clemens to learn about the issues surrounding migration. Some of the topics discussed were: (1) Increased labor mobility as an excellent mechanism for increasing developing world citizens&rsquo; incomes. (2) The restrictiveness of the United States visa program for low-skilled migrant workers. (3) The relatively recent change in the United States migration policy to allow low-skilled migrant workers from Haiti to obtain visas. (4) Government-run migration programs outside of the United States. (5) Examples of successful countries with large migrant populations.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/how-economics-has-benefited-from-immigration.html">Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor and Your Economists, Too</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;First, many economists, especially conservative ones, have a libertarian streak. Ever since Adam Smith taught us about the wonders of free markets and the magic of the invisible hand, we have been loath to prohibit mutually advantageous trades between consenting adults. If an American farmer wants to hire a worker to pick fruits and vegetables, the fact that the worker happens to have been born in Mexico does not seem a compelling reason to stop the transaction. Second, many economists, especially liberal ones, have an egalitarian streak. They follow the philosopher John Rawls&rsquo;s theory of justice in believing that policy should be particularly attuned to its impact on the least fortunate. When thinking about immigration, there is little doubt that the least fortunate, and the ones with the most at stake in the outcome, are the poor workers who yearn to come to the United States to make a better life for themselves and their families.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://robertwiblin.com/2009/10/23/dont-help-refugees-you-bastards/">Don&rsquo;t Help Refugees, You Bastards</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;How can Rudd get away with and indeed benefit from, this hyperbole? I think his reaction is accepted by the public because of this peculiar intuition raised by Katja Grace: someone who avoids having anything to do with a suffering group is unlikely to be condemned for ignoring them but someone who interacts with them, even a little bit, is usually condemned if they don&rsquo;t do a great job at their own expense. Due to their interaction with asylum seekers people smugglers are condemned for failing to provide refugees with boats in good condition free of charge. But because they refuse to have anything to do with these refugees, the Commonwealth of Australia avoids condemnation for failing to do the same, even though it is in a much better position to assist them with their problems than the people smugglers.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://robertwiblin.com/2010/03/05/were-you-against-apartheid/">We&rsquo;re You Against The Apartheid?</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Food for thought from Let Their People Come (page 79): [...] &lsquo;The analogy between apartheid and restrictions on labor mobility is almost exact. People are not allowed to live and work where they please. Rather, some are only allowed to live in places where earning opportunities are scarce. Workers often have to travel long distances and often live far from their families to obtain work. The restrictions about who can work where are based on conditions of birth, not on any notion of individual effort or merit. The current international system of restrictions on labor mobility enforces gaps in living standards across people that are large or larger than any in apartheid South Africa. It is even true that labor restrictions in nearly every case explicitly work to disadvantage people of color against those of European descent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-12-07/migration-as-a-possible-way-of-helping-the-poor">Migration As A Possible Way of Helping The Poor</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Hundreds of millions of people in poor developing nations say they would move to rich nations such as the US and UK, if given the opportunity. However, developed nations only offer work permits to a small percentage of those who would like them. [...] Moving a person to a country that is better organized and makes use of more advanced technology can increase their economic productivity many times over. Reflecting this, the same taxi driver in Swaziland earns multiples of her previous income if she can do the same job in Switzerland. This is a faster and larger financial impact than that offered by any other health, education, or economic empowerment program I know of.&rdquo;</li>

[...] These results are interesting only because the myth that immigrants &lsquo;take jobs&rsquo; is so widespread.

The World Bank estimates that migrants around the world sent home $406 billion dollars last year. Young people move to rich countries, get jobs that pay far better than they could make back home in India or Mexico, and send some of their earnings back home to their families. That money amounts to more than twice the global aid to developing countries. What about the effect on rich countries? Despite the popular debate among immigration, both liberal and conservative economists mostly agree that immigration is good for the US economy. When immigration rises, there are more inventions and patents, more companies founded, more taxpayers, and more young people available to care for our large crop of elders. Some unskilled workers in rich countries do face more competition for jobs. But in general, immigration is a win-win situation.&rdquo;</li>

First, the justices have much more nuanced views across different legal issues than the political science literature has traditionally recognized. Second, the justices are indeed sensitive to the dynamics of public opinion on important issues in society. [...] That public opinion on same-sex marriage has moved significantly in favor of supporting marriage equality is a fact that has been documented by the popular press as well as by political scientists (gated).

Instead, Saulny interviewed young GOP activists and found some who are pro-marriage equality and pro-choice and want their party to focus on the economy and downplay [the social issues.[ Of course attitudes on abortion and gay rights are correlated and it&rsquo;s not surprising that activists who are willing to loudly buck their party on one of these topics may also break from it on another. Moreover, there remain many pro-choice Republican (and pro-life Democratic) voters.

This does not make sense, because same-sex unions promote the values conservatives prize. Marriage is one of the basic building blocks of our neighborhoods and our nation. At its best, it is a stable bond between two individuals who work to create a loving household and a social and economic partnership. We encourage couples to marry because the commitments they make to one another provide benefits not only to themselves but also to their families and communities. Marriage requires thinking beyond one&rsquo;s own needs. It transforms two individuals into a union based on shared aspirations, and in doing so establishes a formal investment in the well-being of society. The fact that individuals who happen to be gay want to share in this vital social institution is evidence that conservative ideals enjoy widespread acceptance. Conservatives should celebrate this, rather than lament it.&rdquo;</li>

An effective employee, no fuss, no muss, a manager&rsquo;s dream. You might as well be describing an ideal vacuum cleaner. I admit that I&rsquo;ve never been able to work that way. There is one thing that always came first and most importantly for me: How am I feeling today? I found that it can easily happen to think of emotions as something that gets in the way of work.

Why Nations Fail is easy to read, with lots of interesting historical stories about different countries. It makes an argument that is appealingly simple: countries with &lsquo;inclusive&rsquo; political and economic institutions are the ones that succeed and survive over the long term. Ultimately, though, the book is a major disappointment. I found the authors&rsquo; analysis vague and simplistic. Beyond their &lsquo;inclusive vs. extractive&rsquo; view of political and economic institutions, they largely dismiss all other factors&mdash;history and logic notwithstanding. Important terms aren&rsquo;t really defined, and they never explain how a country can move to have more &lsquo;inclusive institutions.&rsquo;</li>

The premise is simple: I will try to vanish for a month and start over under a new identity. Wired readers, or whoever else happens upon the chase, will try to find me.

The catch, however, is that you have to pay each time you vote, and the amount you have to pay is a function of the square of the number of votes you cast. As a consequence, each extra vote you cast costs more than the previous vote. Just for the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say the first vote costs you $1. Then to vote a second time would cost $4. The third vote would be $9, the fourth $16, and so on. One hundred votes would cost you $10,000. So eventually, no matter how much you like a candidate, you choose to vote a finite number of times. [...] This voting scheme can work in any situation where there are multiple people trying to choose between two alternatives &mdash; e.g., a group of people trying to decide which movie or restaurant to go to, housemates trying to decide which of two TV&rsquo;s to buy, etc. In settings like those, the pool of money that is collected from people voting would be divided equally and then redistributed to the participants. My hope is that a few of you might be inspired to give this sort of voting scheme a try. If you do, I definitely want to hear about how it works out!&rdquo;</li>

Motivated by this interest, I recently setup a conversation with a hot shot young professor who rose quickly in his field. I asked him about his work habits. Though his answer was detailed &mdash; he had obviously put great thought into these issues &mdash; there was one strategy that caught my attention: he confines his deep work to long, uninterrupted bursts. On small time scales, this means each day is either completely dedicated to a single deep work task, or is left open to deal with all the e-mail and meetings and revisions that also define academic life. If he&rsquo;s going to write a paper, for example, he puts aside two days, and does nothing else, emerging from his immersion with a completed first draft. If he&rsquo;s going to instead deal with requests and logistics, he&rsquo;ll spend the whole day doing so.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-04-01">The Unintuitive Power Laws of Giving</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Why give globally? Why give money? Why health charities? Why single-issue organizations? At first glance these all seem like arbitrary choices: what if I would rather volunteer, or donate to local charities? Why does it matter? It comes down to two distributions: cost-effectiveness and income. [...] Neither of these distributions are intuitive: we don&rsquo;t feel that rich, and charities all seem kind of interchangeable. But understanding them can make the difference between trying to do good and really succeeding.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><b><a href="http://moralitylab.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/YoungDurwin2013.pdf">Moral Realism As Moral Motivation: The Impact of Meta-ethics on Everyday Decision Making</a></b>: &nbsp;&ldquo;People disagree about whether &lsquo;moral facts&rsquo; are objective facts like mathematical truths (moral realism) or simply products of the human mind (moral antirealism). What is the impact of different meta-ethical views on actual behavior? In Experiment 1, a street canvasser, soliciting donations for a charitable organization dedicated to helping impoverished children, primed passersby with realism or antirealism. Participants primed with realism were twice as likely to be donors, compared to control participants and participants primed with antirealism. In Experiment 2, online participants primed with realism as opposed to antirealism reported being willing to donate more money to a charity of their choice. Considering the existence of non-negotiable moral facts may have raised the stakes and motivated participants to behave better. These results therefore reveal the impact of meta-ethics on everyday decision-making: priming a belief in moral realism improved moral behavior.&rdquo;</li>
