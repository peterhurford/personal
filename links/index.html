What is the impact of different meta-ethical views on actual behavior? In Experiment 1, a street canvasser, soliciting donations for a charitable organization dedicated to helping impoverished children, primed passersby with realism or antirealism. Participants primed with realism were twice as likely to be donors, compared to control participants and participants primed with antirealism. In Experiment 2, online participants primed with realism as opposed to antirealism reported being willing to donate more money to a charity of their choice. Considering the existence of non-negotiable moral facts may have raised the stakes and motivated participants to behave better. These results therefore reveal the impact of meta-ethics on everyday decision-making: priming a belief in moral realism improved moral behavior.&rdquo;</li>

[...] Neither of these distributions are intuitive: we don&rsquo;t feel that rich, and charities all seem kind of interchangeable. But understanding them can make the difference between trying to do good and really succeeding.&rdquo;</li>

Motivated by this interest, I recently setup a conversation with a hot shot young professor who rose quickly in his field. I asked him about his work habits. Though his answer was detailed &mdash; he had obviously put great thought into these issues &mdash; there was one strategy that caught my attention: he confines his deep work to long, uninterrupted bursts. On small time scales, this means each day is either completely dedicated to a single deep work task, or is left open to deal with all the e-mail and meetings and revisions that also define academic life. If he&rsquo;s going to write a paper, for example, he puts aside two days, and does nothing else, emerging from his immersion with a completed first draft. If he&rsquo;s going to instead deal with requests and logistics, he&rsquo;ll spend the whole day doing so.&rdquo;</li>

The catch, however, is that you have to pay each time you vote, and the amount you have to pay is a function of the square of the number of votes you cast. As a consequence, each extra vote you cast costs more than the previous vote. Just for the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say the first vote costs you $1. Then to vote a second time would cost $4. The third vote would be $9, the fourth $16, and so on. One hundred votes would cost you $10,000. So eventually, no matter how much you like a candidate, you choose to vote a finite number of times. [...] This voting scheme can work in any situation where there are multiple people trying to choose between two alternatives &mdash; e.g., a group of people trying to decide which movie or restaurant to go to, housemates trying to decide which of two TV&rsquo;s to buy, etc. In settings like those, the pool of money that is collected from people voting would be divided equally and then redistributed to the participants. My hope is that a few of you might be inspired to give this sort of voting scheme a try. If you do, I definitely want to hear about how it works out!&rdquo;</li>

From this point on, there&rsquo;s no such thing as sure. Being too sure will get me caught. [...] Officially it will be another 24 hours before the manhunt begins. That&rsquo;s when Wired&lsquo;s announcement of my disappearance will be posted online. It coincides with the arrival on newsstands of the September issue of the magazine, which contains a page of mugshot-like photos of me, eyes slightly vacant. The premise is simple: I will try to vanish for a month and start over under a new identity. Wired readers, or whoever else happens upon the chase, will try to find me. The idea for the contest started with a series of questions, foremost among them: How hard is it to vanish in the digital age?&rdquo;</li>

Why have some countries prospered and created great living conditions for their citizens, while others have not? This is a topic I care a lot about, so I was eager to pick up a book recently on exactly this topic. Why Nations Fail is easy to read, with lots of interesting historical stories about different countries. It makes an argument that is appealingly simple: countries with &lsquo;inclusive&rsquo; political and economic institutions are the ones that succeed and survive over the long term. Ultimately, though, the book is a major disappointment. I found the authors&rsquo; analysis vague and simplistic. Beyond their &lsquo;inclusive vs. extractive&rsquo; view of political and economic institutions, they largely dismiss all other factors&mdash;history and logic notwithstanding. Important terms aren&rsquo;t really defined, and they never explain how a country can move to have more &lsquo;inclusive institutions.&rsquo;</li>

I fell into this trap, too, believing and parroting the most outrageous claims about impotence, water usage, etc. It took me a long time to realize the point isn&rsquo;t to show how many claims I had memorized, or to glorify my veganism, or to &lsquo;defeat&rsquo; a meat eater.

An effective employee, no fuss, no muss, a manager&rsquo;s dream. You might as well be describing an ideal vacuum cleaner. I admit that I&rsquo;ve never been able to work that way. There is one thing that always came first and most importantly for me: How am I feeling today? I found that it can easily happen to think of emotions as something that gets in the way of work.

This does not make sense, because same-sex unions promote the values conservatives prize. Marriage is one of the basic building blocks of our neighborhoods and our nation. At its best, it is a stable bond between two individuals who work to create a loving household and a social and economic partnership. We encourage couples to marry because the commitments they make to one another provide benefits not only to themselves but also to their families and communities. Marriage requires thinking beyond one&rsquo;s own needs. It transforms two individuals into a union based on shared aspirations, and in doing so establishes a formal investment in the well-being of society. The fact that individuals who happen to be gay want to share in this vital social institution is evidence that conservative ideals enjoy widespread acceptance. Conservatives should celebrate this, rather than lament it.&rdquo;</li>

But I want to make sure that the other forms of inequality that don&rsquo;t get enough press aren&rsquo;t missing from our minds when we consider how we should change the world. [...] A belief in equality means that if another person is suffering much worse than you and you have the means to help them, you&rsquo;d do it.

Instead, Saulny interviewed young GOP activists and found some who are pro-marriage equality and pro-choice and want their party to focus on the economy and downplay [the social issues.[ Of course attitudes on abortion and gay rights are correlated and it&rsquo;s not surprising that activists who are willing to loudly buck their party on one of these topics may also break from it on another. Moreover, there remain many pro-choice Republican (and pro-life Democratic) voters.

There is even some evidence that younger voters are more on the pro-life side of the debate.&rdquo;</li>

The World Bank estimates that migrants around the world sent home $406 billion dollars last year. Young people move to rich countries, get jobs that pay far better than they could make back home in India or Mexico, and send some of their earnings back home to their families. That money amounts to more than twice the global aid to developing countries. What about the effect on rich countries? Despite the popular debate among immigration, both liberal and conservative economists mostly agree that immigration is good for the US economy. When immigration rises, there are more inventions and patents, more companies founded, more taxpayers, and more young people available to care for our large crop of elders. Some unskilled workers in rich countries do face more competition for jobs. But in general, immigration is a win-win situation.&rdquo;</li>

Workers often have to travel long distances and often live far from their families to obtain work. The restrictions about who can work where are based on conditions of birth, not on any notion of individual effort or merit. The current international system of restrictions on labor mobility enforces gaps in living standards across people that are large or larger than any in apartheid South Africa.

Due to their interaction with asylum seekers people smugglers are condemned for failing to provide refugees with boats in good condition free of charge.

If an American farmer wants to hire a worker to pick fruits and vegetables, the fact that the worker happens to have been born in Mexico does not seem a compelling reason to stop the transaction. Second, many economists, especially liberal ones, have an egalitarian streak. They follow the philosopher John Rawls&rsquo;s theory of justice in believing that policy should be particularly attuned to its impact on the least fortunate.

Jason Sadler just wanted to help. He thought he&rsquo;d start with all the leftover T-shirts from his advertising company, I Wear Your Shirt. But judging by the response Sadler got from a group of foreign aid bloggers, you&rsquo;d think he wanted to toss squirrels into wood chippers or steal lunch boxes from fourth-graders. [...] Little did Sadler know he had stumbled into a debate that is raging in the aid world about the best and worst ways to deliver charity, or whether to give at all. He crashed up against a rather simple theory that returned to prominence after aid failures following the 2004 Asian tsunami and 2010 Haiti earthquake: wanting to do something to help is no excuse for not knowing the consequences of what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</li>

Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s Thinking Fast and Slow deals with the very nature of thought, and it just may be the most important book I&rsquo;ve read in many years. Kahneman, a Nobel Laureate in Economics, offers potential solutions that actually might work.

By the charities&rsquo; numbers, a guide dog is very expensive (~$50,000) while cataract surgery is much cheaper (~$25). Assuming you think curing blindness in one eye is about as good as providing a seeing eye dog and training someone to use it, a donation of $200,000 to a seeing eye dog foundation is equivalent to donating $100 to a third world cataract charity: each helps four people.&rdquo;</li>

Collectively, their votes shape public policy. Yet an individual legislator knows that her vote will seldom decide the fate of a given bill. It will however contribute to the shaping of her image. Given that the individual Member of Congress controls his vote but does not control the outcome of legislative battles, he often has reason to vote based on how he would like to be seen. Often the positions a legislator wants to be seen to support and the policy outcomes he favors are closely aligned. Yet when the two diverge he has political reason to vote for what he wants to be seen to favor, rather than the legislative outcome actually he favors. This is especially so, Mayhew argues, because legislators are usually judged on the basis of the positions they take, not on policy outcomes.&rdquo;</li>

But there are many possible reasons for voting. Some people vote because they enjoy it, and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not. Others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not assess the rationality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one&rsquo;s own ballot.

This definition, however, fails to encapsulate the fact that someone can be impoverished even with financial resources. One example he uses to explain this is that of unemployment. Even if someone is able to be recouped the financial loss caused by unemployment, not being able to sustain one&rsquo;s self through employment shows a certain poverty of dignity that most would not want to subject themselves to. This is evidenced by the uneasiness we have when unemployed and being stuck with the question &lsquo;well, what do you do?&rsquo; in social situations.

Home workers also reported substantially higher work satisfaction and psychological attitude scores, and their job attrition rates fell by 50%. Despite this ex post success, the impact of home-working was ex ante unclear to the firm, which is why it ran the experiment.

Libertarians claim that you are perfectly free so long as everybody else leaves you alone, since that way you suffer no interference. But surely we can see that this is mistaken. If left alone, you would dwindle and die. That&rsquo;s not any sort of freedom worth having. Real freedom requires that you be rescued from the well. Until that happens, you lack any opportunities to act and achieve your goals. And that is clearly what really matters.&rdquo;</li>

Fish caught in nets by trawlers are dumped on board the ship and allowed to suffocate. Impaling live bait on hooks is a common commercial practice: long-line fishing, for example, uses hundreds or even thousands of hooks on a single line that may be 50-100km long. When fish take the bait, they are likely to remain caught for many hours before the line is hauled in.&rdquo;</li>

While there&rsquo;s something to the underlying thought here, I think it is often misapplied. If we&rsquo;re not careful, this &lsquo;universalizing&rsquo; reasoning can easily mislead us into accepting stronger conclusions than are actually warranted. For example, advanced economies depend upon there being diverse and specialized professions. So if everyone worked in (say) construction, we&rsquo;d all starve; but that obviously doesn&rsquo;t make working in the construction sector immoral. Even if construction work is widely regarded as permissible, there is no risk of everyone doing it, and hence no risk of disaster. Similarly for choosing not to have children. As these cases suggest, the relevant question turns out to be, not &lsquo;what if everyone did that?&rsquo;, but rather, &lsquo;what if everyone felt free to do that?&rsquo; The answer to this latter question will often be, appropriately enough, &lsquo;no problem!&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>

Even setting aside the harm that smokers inflict on nonsmokers, the free-to-choose argument is unconvincing with a drug as highly addictive as tobacco, and it becomes even more dubious when we consider that most smokers take up the habit as teenagers and later want to quit. Reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarette smoke to a level that was not addictive might meet this objection.&rdquo;</li>

How it works is that someone will be trying to solve a problem they have, say a lack of confidence around other people. They&rsquo;ll come across a piece of advice or a motivational snippet that will lead them have an epiphany or a profound realization. This often happens when someone is reading self-help books or articles. [...] The problem with these epiphanies is that they can make you feel really charged up, and like something has clicked into place in your mind, and that your life will be different from now on. They usually don&rsquo;t lead to any tangible results though. You walk around for a day or two feeling ready to take on the world, but you don&rsquo;t act any differently, and the &lsquo;high&rsquo; soon wears off.&rdquo;</li>

But the reality is that our civilization, today, is probably the safest and most peaceful that the planet has ever known.

Parents can still impact their kids&rsquo; biological development &ndash; to take an extreme example, if you malnourish a baby, that&rsquo;s going to hurt brain development. They can still guide them into certain areas by, again to take an extreme example, making them go to music lessons every day starting at age four. But they don&rsquo;t have to worry that by being too strict or not strict enough or just the right amount of strict but at the wrong time they&rsquo;re going to seriously harm their children&rsquo;s adult personalities.

The first party&rsquo;s response is based not only on whether the person&rsquo;s excuse is believable, not even on whether the person&rsquo;s excuse is morally valid, but on whether the excuse can be accepted without straining the credibility of their previous pre-commitment. The general principle is that by accepting an excuse, a rule-maker is also committing themselves to accepting all equally good excuses in the future.&rdquo;</li>

Most notably, what we got was a test of demand-side versus supply-side stories about the nature of depressions. [...] How could you tell which story was right? One answer was to look at the behavior of interest rates; the other was to look at inflation. For if you believed a demand-side story, you would also believe that even a large monetary expansion would have little inflationary effect; if you believed a supply-side story, you would expect lots of inflation from too much money chasing a reduced supply of goods. And indeed, people on the right have been forecasting runaway inflation for years now. Yet the predicted inflation keeps not coming.&rdquo;</li>

Could I make that tradeoff? [...] I also think there&rsquo;s only so much grief we can carry. I cannot go the next 70 years counting dead children on every receipt. I would break. So my advice is to spend a while really noticing that tradeoff. Notice whether you really do value the milkshake more than a child&rsquo;s vaccination. And then, after a time, make yourself a budget that reflects those values. Set aside money for unnecessary things that make you happy. Do what you think will nurture you to age 100 as a generous and strategic giver. Because that, in the end, is what will help the most people.&rdquo;</li>

In addition to trials where evidence was presented and a verdict rendered, they also gave us democracy. In fact, we can find much closer representations of our current form of government in ancient Greek and Roman forms than we can in any Christian government formed before 1700. The omnipresence of the religious symbolism of Justitis (and even the very name Justice) tells us the true origin of these concepts. We are not so much a Christian nation as we are an ancient pagan Greek nation. We show this by continuing to include ancient pagan Greek and Roman religious symbolism in our government documents.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>

It is argued first that (1) is not the best explanation of the evidence from moral practice, and second that even if it were, the error theory would still be mistaken, because the assumption does not contaminate the meaning or truth-conditions of moral claims.

In 1870, however, huge diamond mines were discovered near the Orange River, in South Africa, where diamonds were soon being scooped out by the ton. Suddenly, the market was deluged with diamonds. The British financiers who had organized the South African mines quickly realized that their investment was endangered; diamonds had little intrinsic value&mdash;and their price depended almost entirely on their scarcity.

My hypothesis &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true &ndash; is that this is only cliched now because Sartre won. The point of studying Sartre is not to learn that you choose your own identity, but to read him backward &ndash; to start with this idea that choosing your own identity is obvious, and then read Sartre to learn exactly how controversial it was at the time and what sorts of arguments Sartre had to go through to get people to accept it, and eventually understand the position that the original reader of Sartre was supposed to have started with.&rdquo;</li>

Pinker presents a tremendous amount of evidence that humans have gradually become much less violent and much more humane. The trend started thousands of years ago and has continued to this day.

If the physical act of murder has a little physical tag attached to it, made of atoms, which says &lsquo;bad&rsquo;, then the Universe&rsquo;s complexity is vastly increased.

Since he mentioned life, he proposed that the first life-forms had come about as random arrangements of atoms, and that other more complicated life-forms evolved from these first forms by natural selection. Humans were merely another life-form that had evolved in this way, albeit the most advanced and rational.

There seems no doubt that people&rsquo;s welfare (and, more broadly, the welfare of sentient beings) is worth caring about. Is anything else comparably important, or worth caring about? Take promises. People sometimes criticize utilitarianism on the grounds that it affords no intrinsic significance to promise-keeping, so utilitarians may be expected to break promises (at least when it&rsquo;s sufficiently clear that it really would be for the best). But does it really make sense to care about promises more than people? That sounds terribly perverse! Promises can be a useful tool for coordination, and hence serving our collective interests.

When we consider flow-through effects of our actions, the seemingly vast gaps in cost-effectiveness among charities are humbled to more modest differences, and we begin to find more worth in the diversity of activities that different people are pursuing.

When you wanted to go out, you&rsquo;d pay a couple hours to someone else to watch your kids; then when they wanted to go out, they&rsquo;d pay you or someone else to do the same for them. It all worked great for a while, until one day they found they had too few pieces of scrip. Every couple had only a couple hours left and, having so little, they didn&rsquo;t want to waste it. So they all decided to save it for a very special occasion. This was kind of an incredible situation &mdash; even though there were people who wanted someone to babysit their kids, and people who were willing to do just that, the deal didn&rsquo;t happen, simply because the co-op hadn&rsquo;t printed enough colored pieces of paper.

They claim that they&rsquo;re trying to save migrants from deadly border crossings by deterring them from making the journey to begin with. &nbsp;But their compassion is empty. There&rsquo;s a reason migrants make those journeys: the places they&rsquo;re leaving are more dangerous than the border journey itself. And by refusing to make the journeys any easier &mdash; or making them even more dangerous &mdash; the rich governments of the world are putting thousands of migrants in even more danger, both on the journey and at home.&ldquo;</li>

Also, have 2-4 testimonials (no more, no less) scattered throughout the page. Have a very clear call to action (e.g., a &lsquo;buy&rsquo; button) Need to reverse the risk (e.g., a money back guarantee). Helps if that reversal is outlandish (e.g., 110% refund).

However, on the ninth person there is another tipping point where stand-ups become too long and Pivotal Tracker becomes too crowded and things begin again to break down. At this point, the team needs to be split into 2+ smaller teams with (a) clear spheres of authority and (b) clear interfaces to other teams. &nbsp;But be careful, as &ldquo;[d]raw the fences in the wrong place, and you&rsquo;ll create coordination problems that make things even worse[, though f]ind the right places to divide and you&rsquo;ll see a massive increase in focus, happiness, and productivity.&rdquo;</li>

Here&rsquo;s How We Fixed Ours</a></b>:  Job ads should not look like they&rsquo;re filling in blanks with random adjectives but should paint a compelling picture of what the day-to-day of the job is like and what makes your job unique and exciting. You also need clear criteria of who you want to hire prior to writing your job listing with realistic but high expectations. Your interview process should then simulate the actual work environment as much as possible and test for technical skill in addition to other important skills such as taking direction, communication style, applying feedback, personality, etc.</li>

This means that you should take enough seed money and be frugal enough with your seed money to be able to show concrete progress and metrics to prove you deserve a Series A on more than hope and dreams.</li>

However, a new study found that when you separate entrepreneurs who own incorporated companies (e.g., startups) from those who don&rsquo;t (e.g., freelancers), it is the case that those who own incorporated companies earn more on average than similar people who stay salaried. Furthermore, those who own incorporated companies and are willing to give up control in exchange for growth (e.g., by taking external investment) earn even more than similar people who don&rsquo;t.</li>

Diverse teams tend to have worse communication and more conflict, but also tend to be more creative, innovative, and better at problem solving. Remote teams, more balanced teams, and teams that have been together longer have less negative ramifications of diversity.</li>

There is medium evidence that this is also true for upper-to-medium-tier colleges. It is still easy to get into medium-to-lower-tier colleges. Until 1900, there was no competition for top colleges, medical schools, or law schools. A secular trend towards increasing admissions (increasing wealth + demand for skills?) plus two shocks from the GI Bill and the Vietnam draft led to a glut of applicants that overwhelmed schools and forced them to begin selecting applicants. Changes up until ten years ago were because of a growing applicant pool, after which the applicant pool (both domestic and international) stopped growing and started shrinking. Increased competition since ten years ago does not involve applicant pool size. Changes after ten years ago are less clear, but the most important factor is probably the ease of applying to more colleges. [&hellip;] All the hand-wringing about getting into good colleges is probably a waste of time, unless you are from a disadvantaged background. For most people, admission to a more selective college does not translate into a more lucrative career or a higher chance of admission to postgraduate education.

A +1 SD better teacher might cause a +0.1 SD year-on-year improvement in test scores. This decays quickly with time and is probably disappears entirely after four or five years, though there may also be small lingering effects. It&rsquo;s hard to rule out the possibility that other factors, like endogenous sorting of students, or students&rsquo; genetic potential, contributes to this as an artifact, and most people agree that these sorts of scores combine some signal with a lot of noise. For some reason, even though teachers&rsquo; effects on test scores decay very quickly, studies have shown that they have significant impact on earning as much as 20 or 25 years later, so much so that kindergarten teacher quality can predict thousands of dollars of difference in adult income. This seemingly unbelievable finding has been replicated in quasi-experiments and even in real experiments and is difficult to banish. Since it does not happen through standardized test scores, the most likely explanation is that it involves non-cognitive factors like behavior. I really don&rsquo;t know whether to believe this and right now I say 50-50 odds that this is a real effect or not &ndash; mostly based on low priors rather than on any weakness of the studies themselves. I don&rsquo;t understand this field very well and place low confidence in anything I have to say about it.&rdquo;</li>

There seems to be little or no racial bias in arrests for serious violent crime, police shootings in most jurisdictions, prosecutions, or convictions. Overall I disagree with the City Journal claim that there is no evidence of racial bias in the justice system. But I also disagree with the people who say things like &#39;Every part of America&rsquo;s criminal justice is systemically racist by design&rsquo; or &#39;White people can get away with murder but black people are constantly persecuted for any minor infraction&rsquo; [&hellip;] It would be nice to say that this shows the criminal justice system is not disproportionately harming blacks, but unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t come anywhere close to showing anything of the sort.

Why deep learning works differently than we thought</a></b>:  How do neural networks recognize a cat? A widely accepted answer to this question is: by detecting its shape. - &ldquo;We conducted a series of nine experiments encompassing nearly a hundred human observers and many widely used deep neural networks (AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DenseNet-121, SqueezeNet1_1), showing them hundreds of images with conflicting shapes and textures. The results left little room for doubt: we found striking evidence in favor of the texture explanation! A cat with:lephant skin is an elephant to deep neural networks, and still a cat to humans. A car with the texture of a clock is a clock to deep neural networks, as much as a bear with the surface characteristics of a bottle is recognized as a bottle. Current deep learning techniques for object recognition primarily rely on textures, not on object shapes.&rdquo;</li>

And because of the shift to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, this will eventually happen. [&hellip;] But banning fracking too quickly might jeopardize this crucial transition. Why? Because switching to renewable energy requires a lot of energy. Solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric cars must be manufactured in huge quantities. Buildings must be retrofitted with new electrical wiring and energy efficiency technologies. [&hellip;] All of this will take huge amounts of energy &ndash; electricity and vehicle fuel. Where will it come from? Currently, renewable sources account for only 11% of U.S. primary energy consumption. [&hellip;] You can&rsquo;t use solar and wind to build the generation capacity for more solar and wind until you have a lot of it. The U.S. simply isn&rsquo;t there yet &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have enough green energy to power the transition. Instead, if fracking is banned immediately, the U.S. will probably go back to using coal and imported oil (Sanders has also proposed banning the other option, nuclear power). This will mean much greater carbon emission and deadly air pollution from coal. It will also would push up global oil prices, generating big windfalls for leaders like Russia&rsquo;s President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Mohammad Bin Salman. Such a reversal would be a terrible shame.&rdquo;</li>

Here&rsquo;s a reality check &ndash; no one is under any obligation to put on any clothing they don&rsquo;t want to, and North Face and REI are not entitled to your hard-earned money. All that these increasingly strident claims about jackets do is shame underprivileged people who can&rsquo;t afford jackets, suggesting them as legitimate targets for violence.

But it hasn&rsquo;t been enough, and as Californians now face the realities of climate change by the terrified millions, the only choices left are hard vs. hard: Black out even more people. Ban wildland homebuilding. Bury power lines. Build microgrids. Break up the state&rsquo;s largest utility &mdash; the bankrupt one supplying half of the state &mdash; and give its aging, spark-spewing equipment to taxpayers or customers or hedge funds or Warren Buffett.

The loss of trust mostly isn&rsquo;t the pollsters&rsquo; fault. It&rsquo;s the media&rsquo;s fault. Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m going there. The loss of trust in polls was enabled, in large part, by reporting and analysis that incorrectly portrayed the polls as showing an almost-certain Clinton win when in fact they showed a close and highly uncertain Electoral College race[. &hellip;] Not only do polls have a margin of sampling error [&hellip;] but they also have other types of errors, such as nonresponse bias.

No, not quite. Instead, you need a sum of squares formula. To save you some math, here are a few useful benchmarks: For a high-quality, 1,000-person national poll, a good estimate of the true margin of error is about plus or minus 4 percentage points. For a national polling average, meanwhile, the true margin of error is about plus or minus 3 percentage points. [&hellip;] That means for a high-quality, 1,000-person national poll, the true margin of error for the margin between candidates &mdash; or a candidate&rsquo;s net approval rating &mdash; is about 8 percentage points.

That&rsquo;s because you need to exercise them&ndash;i.e., pay the company money&ndash;in order to exchange the option for &nbsp;actual shares. Exercising the options costs a lot of money, so all else equal you would want to wait until the you&rsquo;re sure the stock is valuable to exercise. (For instance, you might wait until the company goes public, so you know you can sell the stock on the stock market.) But there are two downsides to that approach. First, depending on your company&rsquo;s policies, you might have to give up your options if you leave or are fired. Second, if you sell the stock too soon after you exercise the options, you&rsquo;ll get much worse tax treatment. That means &nbsp;you&rsquo;ll be caught between (a) paying twice as much in taxes as an equity holder, or (b) risking losing most of your gains because the stock price moved against you at the wrong time. So from a tax perspective, the best time to exercise the options is as soon as they&rsquo;re granted to you (before they even vest). This is known as &ldquo;early exercise&rdquo; or an &ldquo;83(b) election.&rdquo; Unfortunately, early exercise can cost a lot of money up front, and if the company doesn&rsquo;t succeed, you&rsquo;ll lose it all. That makes the decision process kind of complicated.&rdquo;</li>

[&hellip;] When I do this, it&rsquo;s not unusual for me to end up asking questions that the other person hasn&rsquo;t really thought about before.

[&hellip;] I find the cases where the other person hasn&rsquo;t thought about the question to be striking, because it means that I as a naive outsider can ask natural-seeming questions that haven&rsquo;t been considered before by an expert in the field. I think what is going on here is that I and my interlocutor are using different paradigms (in the Kuhnian sense) for determining what questions are worth asking in a field. [&hellip;] think that as a scientist (or really, even as a citizen) it is important to be able to see outside one&rsquo;s own paradigm. [&hellip;] Based on the above experiences, I plan to use the following test: When someone asks me a question about my field, how often have I not thought about it before? How tempted am I to say, &lsquo;That question isn&rsquo;t interesting&rsquo;? If these start to become more common, then I&rsquo;ll know something has gone wrong.&rdquo;</li>

But to the people who call themselves &lsquo;neoliberal&rsquo; now, it does not mean that. The people who now call themselves &ldquo;neoliberals&rdquo; are the heirs to a different tradition - the liberals of the 1990s who responded to the failure of communism and the excesses of libertarianism by creating a new, center-left technocratic policy program. [&hellip;] Neoliberalism, as defined by its current adherents (rather than by its squawking enemies), views markets as the fundamental generators of prosperity, and government as the way to distribute that prosperity more equitably. [&hellip;] It sees free trade and globalization, along with strong welfare states in rich countries, as the best way to make the world more prosperous and more equal at the same time. [&hellip;] Now, am I really a neoliberal? [..] No. I am not[. ..] I&rsquo;ve come to believe in export promotion, which is anathema to many neoliberals, since it&rsquo;s a restriction on free trade. [&hellip;] The government *must* pick winners. Green energy and other zero-carbon technologies being chief among the things we must pick. I also believe in national health insurance, which is just straight-up nationalization of a major industry. So there are many ways in which my economic ideas diverge strongly from neoliberalism (that was not an exhaustive list). But just because I&rsquo;m not really a neoliberal doesn&rsquo;t mean I think neoliberalism is bad. I think it&rsquo;s a valuable perspective we still need. Just as free-market libertarianism went too far, so will the new socialism go too far someday (if it ever manages to take power). We will need people who remember the value of markets, but who are NOT plutocrats or racists, to temper and restrain that overreach. If the job of restraining the inevitable excesses of socialism doesn&rsquo;t fall to the Clintonite technocratic center-left, it will fall to the right - to libertarians, racist &ldquo;economic nationalists&rdquo;, etc. And that would be bad. Neoliberals&rsquo; disagreement with leftists comes less from their goals - both want a prosperous, equal society - but from the methods they think will be most effective for getting there. And that is a healthy disagreement. Or it should be, anyway.&rdquo;</li>

Treat specific intellectual opponents with respect, in print and otherwise, even if they don&rsquo;t reciprocate. &nbsp;But feel free to ridicule ridiculous ideas. [&hellip;] 7. Don&rsquo;t keep your cards close to your chest. &nbsp;Share your sincere probabilities with your readers. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t just tell them what you can &lsquo;prove.&rsquo; Tell them anything interesting that you&rsquo;re willing to bet on &ndash; and at what odds.&rdquo;</li>

Also (2) more seasonal work visas have reduced illegal immigration drastically.

Equality of &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; is desirable, but equality of &lsquo;outcome&rsquo; is not. As they frame it, one of these is fairly basic while the other is radical and frightening. [&hellip;] The people who distinguish opportunity and outcome often do so in order to discourage us from trying to redistribute wealth from rich to poor&mdash;what matters is not whether people end up highly unequal, but whether they have the same opportunities at the start. If life is a race, it&rsquo;s okay if there are &lsquo;winners&rsquo; and &lsquo;losers&rsquo; so long as the race is played fairly. [&hellip;] But there are severe problems with this way of looking at things. For one, it makes no sense. It sounds nice, but when you start examining it closely, the boundaries between &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; and &lsquo;outcome&rsquo; become very unclear. One generation&rsquo;s outcomes structure the next generation&rsquo;s opportunities. Let&rsquo;s say we start with a fair economic &lsquo;race,&rsquo; but then a few people become much richer than others. Those people can send their children to private schools, they can pass on all of their connections and knowledge and wealth to their children. Even if Generation A has equal opportunities, Generation A&rsquo;s unequal outcomes mean that Generation B will have dramatic variations in opportunities. If you want to create equal opportunities, you&rsquo;ll have to constantly be meddling with outcomes.&rdquo;</li>

Nothing else had changed because nothing else had to; the underlying itch being scratched was the same. They just had to CTRL+F and replace a couple of keywords. Eventually, things came full circle. I started this essay with a memory of noticing that my favorite early-2000s-era website had two off-topic forums: one for religion vs. atheism, and one for everything else. Earlier this year, SSC&rsquo;s subreddit split in two: one for &ldquo;culture war&rdquo; discussions mostly about race and gender, the other for everything else. [&hellip;] I&rsquo;ve lost the exact quote, but a famous historian once said that we learn history to keep us from taking the present too seriously. This isn&rsquo;t to say the problems of the present aren&rsquo;t serious. Just that history helps us avoid getting too dazzled by current trends, or too swept away by any particular narrative. If this is true, we might do well to study the history of New Atheism a little more seriously.&rdquo;</li>

You should not have to claim some unusual level of diligence to feel entitled to a good standard of living. [&hellip;] If there were some sort of way of quantifying &lsquo;hard work,&rsquo; through which you could prove that your wealth was truly earned, is there any possible way one could show that they had &lsquo;earned&rsquo; a billion dollars? Do billionaires work that many magnitudes more hours than waitresses? Is their work that many magnitudes more strenuous? Are they that many magnitudes more stressed? (Billionaires might believe so; that just shows they&rsquo;ve never been waitresses.) Brandishing the concept of &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; in order to justify why some people live in miserable poverty and others have sports car collections is just nonsensical, an obvious distraction away from the question of why these disparities are so vast and unjust. Honestly, &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; is such a vague and slippery concept that we&rsquo;d probably all be better off if we just threw it out. And once we stop playing this pointless game of comparing how hard we all work, we can start asking the real question of when we&rsquo;re going to start being compensated fairly for it.&rdquo;</li>

Many of the white working-class voters in the Rust Belt who supported the president in 2016 were traditionally Democratic voters who backed President Obama in 2012 and even continued to vote Democratic down-ballot in 2016. Democrats generally held on to these voters in 2018, but the reasons many of them voted for Mr. Trump, like his promises on immigration or the economy, could still be relevant.&rdquo;</li>

This is based largely on writers anecdotally reporting they write best first thing early in the morning, apparently even if they are not morning people, although there is some additional survey/software-logging evidence of morning writing being effective. I compile all the anecdotes of writers discussing their writing times I have come across thus far. Do they, and why?&ldquo; It appears that while the morning affect does seem substantiated by a survey of anecdotal evidence, there isn&rsquo;t much theoretical basis for it and just pure &ldquo;deep work&rdquo; might be what matters most.</li>

Despite that, we operate more like a tech company than a social enterprise. Our investors are venture capitalists trying to make a high return, and they hold us to the same standards of growth rate and unit economics as any developed-world startup. This might seem like a downside (surely it would be easier to directly optimize for impact rather than have pressure from investors to make money?), but for us it&rsquo;s actually increased our impact in two ways. First, the pressure to grow quickly forces us to make our product better and scale faster, so we help more people by a larger amount. Second, since we&rsquo;ve done really well by for-profit investors&rsquo; standards, we can raise much more money than a nonprofit or social enterprise. [&hellip;] The &ldquo;local context plus high standards&rdquo; theory suggests a simple (though not easy!) strategy to build a high-quality business that helps the global poor: (1) Move to a developing country to understand your future users, (2) Learn the startup playbook (for instance, by doing Y Combinator), (3) Start a business whose users are in the place you live. The remainder of this post fleshes out this strategy.&rdquo;</li>

The most important thing to remember is that success in subscription video services requires two things: Getting a subscriber, and keeping a subscriber. The second is harder. Much harder. And since we are giving out free advice, here are 10 tips for the current and future contenders: 1. Spend today on the content library that will make financial sense five years from now. [&hellip;, ] 2. The only arbiters of the quality of your content and service is the audience. [&hellip;] Audiences like content that is &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; They even like pretending they don&rsquo;t like certain content and will go out of their way to complain about it. [&hellip;] You probably need more content than you think. If your audience isn&rsquo;t complaining about having too many series they want to watch, they&rsquo;ll pause their subscription and come back when you have them. [&hellip;] At a certain point, the value of unwatched content is negative, not zero. [&hellip;] You don&rsquo;t need sophisticated metrics to tell if your audience likes your content. All you need to know is, &ldquo;Are they coming back?&rdquo; The more complicated the analysis, the more likely it has been exaggerated. 3. The best way to build your streaming subscription service is to rebrand and cannibalize another business that already has lots of users and, ideally, money. [&hellip;] 4. If you actually want to make money, subscription streaming shouldn&rsquo;t even be your real business. Instead, give it away as a free or low-cost perk that&rsquo;s part of a much higher-margin and less-competitive business, such as wireless service, smartphones, e-commerce subscriptions, or theme park passes. [&hellip;] 6. Ultimately, you need hits. A single breakout can double your subscriber growth (though again, you&rsquo;ll need more hits to keep these subscribers), but a bunch of niche &ldquo;hits&rdquo; makes only for a niche service. Unfortunately, these hits are hard to produce and even harder to predict. So when you think you&rsquo;ve got one, pay whatever it takes to get the rights, reshoot a pilot, or fix the creative. [&hellip;] 9. To be successful, you have to solve a problem. This cannot be a problem you created. A few hardcore fans might chase Jim and Pam across the streaming landscape, but most will just watch something other than The Office. But if you say, &ldquo;We are the home for all things Marvel,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll happily choose you over sifting through Triple Frontier and The Ridiculous Six to find Thor: Ragnarok.&rdquo;</li>

If they&rsquo;re struggling with diet, they&rsquo;ll try to make meal plans and nutrition logs and whatever &ndash; all good stuff, really &ndash; but keep falling off and failing. The person who naturally eats well and struggles with money does the opposite. They don&rsquo;t go deep into nutrition and eating, because they&rsquo;re happy there. Meanwhile, they keep trying to put together budgets, track spending, pay more attention to money &ndash; all good stuff, really &ndash; but keep falling off and failing. I recommend you do the opposite: learn fundamentals of self-management, tracking, learning, and improvement in an easy and naturally-skilled area for you first.

Sunstein, co-author of Nudge, Obama White House official, and by far the most cited legal scholar of the late 2000s, aims to unravel the mystery and figure out the implications in his new book How Change Happens. He pulls together three phenomena which social scientists have studied in recent decades: preference falsification, variable thresholds for action, and group polarisation. If Sunstein is to be believed, together these are a cocktail for social shifts that are chaotic and fundamentally unpredictable. In brief, people constantly misrepresent their true views, even to close friends and family. They themselves aren&rsquo;t quite sure how socially acceptable their feelings would have to become before they revealed them or joined a campaign for change. And a chance meeting between a few strangers can be the spark that radicalises a handful of people who then find a message that can spread their beliefs to millions. According to Sunstein, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;much, much easier&rdquo; to create social change when large numbers of people secretly or latently agree with you. But &lsquo;preference falsification&rsquo; is so pervasive that it&rsquo;s no simple matter to figure out when they do.&rdquo;</li>

For Democrats the share was just over six percent in 1972, but it&rsquo;s dropped in half by 2018. For Republicans the climb has been upward, with just under 5% being totally opposed to abortion in 1972 compared to 8.5% of Republicans in 2018. [&hellip;T]he share of Republicans who wanted to place no restrictions on abortion was the same as the Democrats in the 1970&rsquo;s. Then, support for that position began to drop. However, the decline was much steeper for Republicans &ndash; 40% of Republican were totally pro-choice in the 1970&rsquo;s, but that fell to just under 15% by the mid-2000&rsquo;s, only to rebound about five percentage points recently. The Democrats have seen a slightly different pattern. From their high of 37% completely pro-choice in the early 1970&rsquo;s, they dropped to just above 20% in the mid-2000&rsquo;s. There was a big bounce back for Democrats, though. Now about 35% of Democrats could be called completely pro-choice. The gap between two parties on the 100% pro-choice group is now the largest it&rsquo;s ever been, with Democrats being twice as likely to always favor abortion than Republicans. One would have to think that an individual&rsquo;s view of abortion is based, in large part, on their religious tradition. The data largely confirms that, but there are some interesting results. Of the group of people who favor a woman&rsquo;s choice to an abortion in all six scenarios, just over a third are religiously unaffiliated. However, the group that shows up the second most is Catholics. Obviously, that&rsquo;s a function of the size of the Catholic population in the United States, but it also speaks to the fact that lots of Catholics are diametrically opposed to the Church&rsquo;s teaching on abortion. That comes even more into focus when considering that despite the fact that evangelicals made up nearly a quarter of the sample, they are just 12.7% of 100% pro-choice respondents. When looking at those who are 100% pro-life, it&rsquo;s basically evangelicals, Catholics, and then everyone else. Nearly half of all 100% pro-life people are evangelicals, while 30% are Catholics.&rdquo;</li>

Rates and time vary with the discipline of the degree achieved and the amount of tuition assistance the student obtained. An ISA is dramatically more student-friendly than a loan. All the risk shifts from the student to the investing entity; if a career starts slowly, or not at all, the student&rsquo;s obligation drops or goes to zero. Think of an ISA as equity instead of debt, or as working one&rsquo;s way through college &mdash; after college. [&hellip;] If you watch Shark Tank the entrepreneurs are always wary about debt because debt puts all the risk on them and requires fixed payments regardless. Yet when it comes to financing the venture of one&rsquo;s own life suddenly equity becomes akin to slavery and debt bondage becomes freedom! It&rsquo;s very peculiar. Another advantage of ISAs is that they provide feedback. Is the university willing to educate you for free in return for a share of future earnings? That&rsquo;s a good signal!&rdquo;</li>

And I was not alone in that judgment: In 1968, more than 1000 economists signed a letter endorsing such a plan, including luminaries like James Tobin, Paul Samuelson, Peter Diamond, and Martin Feldstein. Andrew Yang&rsquo;s version, which focuses on taxing consumption rather than income, is even better than Friedman&rsquo;s, because it wouldn&rsquo;t distort the incentive to save and invest.&rdquo;</li>

The official statistics are confusing, but they show no signs of increases in this phenomenon. On the other hand, there are signs of technological underemployment – robots taking middle-skill jobs and then pushing people into other jobs. [...] This sort of thing has been happening for centuries and in theory everyone should eventually adjust, but there are some signs that they aren't. This may have as much to do with changes to the educational, political, and economic system as with the nature of robots per se. Economists are genuinely divided on how this is going to end up, and whether this will just be a temporary blip while people develop new skills, or the new normal. Technology seems poised to disrupt lots of new industries very soon, and could replace humans entirely sometime within the next hundred years. This is a very depressing conclusion. If technology didn't cause problems, that would be great. If technology made lots of people unemployed, that would be hard to miss, and the government might eventually be willing to subsidize something like a universal basic income. But we won't get that. We'll just get people being pushed into worse and worse jobs, in a way that does not inspire widespread sympathy or collective action.

In the reverse case, a time-traveler from the past to the future wishes to prove he is from the past and that time-travel is real. How can he do this when all past knowledge is already known or whose chain of custody being broken is more likely than time-travel being real? I suggest 8 methods: carbon-14 nuclear isotope dating of their body as isotopes cannot be removed; sequencing of their genome to check consistency with pedigree as human genomes cannot be synthesized or edited on a large scale; selection & mutation clocks, likewise; immune system signatures of extinct or rare diseases such as smallpox, and accumulated pollution such as heavy metals, difficult & dangerous to fake.

Additionally, for every hour of time spent on a Smartphone, time spent in meetings, eating (presumably with friends), and time spent with friends goes up.

[However,] Russian procurement dwarfs that of most European powers combined. [...] The reason for this apparent contradiction is that the use of market exchange rates grossly understates the real volume of Russian military expenditure (and that of other countries with smaller per-capita incomes, like China). Instead, any analysis of comparative military expenditure should be based on the use of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates rather than market exchange rates. [...] As we demonstrate, despite some shortcomings, PPP is a much more methodologically robust and defensible method of comparing defense spending across countries[. ...] Using PPP, one finds that Russia's effective military expenditure actually ranged between $150 billion and $180 billion annually over the last five years. That figure is conservative; taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure, Russia may well come in at around $200 billion. [...] The gap is even narrower when one digs into the differences in how this money is spent. At nearly 50 percent of federal budget spending on national defense, a large proportion of the Russian defense budget goes to procurement and research and development. By comparison, in other countries with large defense budgets, procurement spending tends to be much lower: in India, the United States, and the United Kingdom, spending is at about 20–25 percent. Unlike some other large military spenders - for example, Saudi Arabia and India - Russia also produces most of its weaponry itself and does not buy its equipment from countries with higher costs.&rdquo;</li>

The fractured nature of the work, the short amount of time provided, and the speed of change all undermine learning beyond the superficial. It's shocking, really, that students learn as much as they do. [...] he solution, to me anyway, seems almost too easy. Students should have two long classes each day for six to eight weeks. They should come to school in the morning and intensely study a single subject-ancient history, a few Shakespeare plays, cell biology, a specific math concept, and so on.

Meetings cost them more. There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour. [...] But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started. When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster.

Seek social support, sleep, seek clarity in your role and goals, shorten your commute, buy yourself out of work-life conflict, and keep a healthy personal runway. What can organizations do? Define clear roles and norms, provide clear feedback, provide achievable goals, facilitate social support, facilitate telecommuting and flexible work hours, facilitate sleep, provide offices (or at least cubicles), provide autonomy, find ways to measure productivity other than hours worked, and professionalize management. Vacations don't help. </li>

The list above clearly demonstrates that the root causes of burnout do not really lie with the individual and that they can be averted - if only leadership started their prevention strategies much further upstream.&rdquo;</li>

  <li><b><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807.pdf">Inherent Trade-Offs in the Fair Determination of Risk Scores</a></b>: Recent discussion in the public sphere about algorithmic classification has involved tension between competing notions of what it means for a probabilistic classification to be fair to different groups. We formalize three fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and we prove that except in highly constrained special cases, there is no method that can satisfy these three conditions simultaneously. Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem. These results suggest some of the ways in which key notions of fairness are incompatible with each other, and hence provide a framework for thinking about the trade-offs between them. </li>

Our analysis is based on over one hundred machine learning competitions hosted on the Kaggle platform over the course of several years. In each competition, numerous practitioners repeatedly evaluated their progress against a holdout set that forms the basis of a public ranking available throughout the competition. Performance on a separate test set used only once determined the final ranking. By systematically comparing the public ranking with the final ranking, we assess how much participants adapted to the holdout set over the course of a competition. Our study shows, somewhat surprisingly, little evidence of substantial overfitting. These findings speak to the robustness of the holdout method across different data domains, loss functions, model classes, and human analysts. </li>

This is because you really need to avoid a situation where the mother has a much better understanding of the baby than you do. For example, you can get into a cycle where you can't calm the baby as well, they spend more time with their mother, you get less experience and practice with them, and your relative abilities with the baby get farther and farther apart.&rdquo;</li>

In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Specifically, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics, and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO2 and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2 (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts, and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.&rquo;</li>

Lightfoot’s budget is the kind of incremental improvement that’s stereotypically eschewed by socialists, but it feels like more than just socialism that is driving her harshest critics, and conflict theory seems to explain the remainder of the variance. I think Lightfoot’s biggest mistake in this process was probably her initial, premature promise to reopen the clinics, which gave her political opponents fodder come budget time, but (if I’m right about conflict theory) had little chance of winning them over.&rdquo;</li>
