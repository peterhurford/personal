						<h2><a href="stats/seniorresearch.pdf" rel="bookmark" >Participation and Optimism</a></h2>
						<p>"Participation and Optimism in the Political Context: How Optimism Both Helps and Hinders Political Participation" is my senior thesis in political psychology.  It was found that optimism did not provide a general resiliency against feelings of electoral loss as expected, but instead functioned as a moderating variable that amplified pre-existing positive or negative effects. Special attention to specific measures of optimism in political science, including a custom political optimism battery, is also discussed.</p>
