                    <p>I've made a variety of New Years Resolutions this year to commit to exercise.  I decided that I want a more detailed log to keep track of my progress on these plans so I know where to resume for future exercises and look back on my progress.</p>

					<p>Currently, I'm working on <a href="http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/">Stronglifts 5x5 Beginner Strength Training Program</a> (lifting three times a week) and running twice a week.</p>
