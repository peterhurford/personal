                  <p>I think <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.com/">donating money to the right places is important</a>. To that effect, <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">I have taken the Giving What We Can pledge</a> on June 26, 2012 - pledging to donate 10% of my income for the rest of my life to the organizations that can use it most effectively to improve the lives of others. I've been keeping this log of places I've been donating for accountability, transparency, and inspiration.</p>
