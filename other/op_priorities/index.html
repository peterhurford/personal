		<h2>Urgent Update: New OpenPhil Priorities</h2>
		<p>I was just talking with Holden and he said that as of yesterday OpenPhil's new top three priorities are:
		  <ol>
        <li id="priority1"></li>
        <li id="priority2"></li>
        <li id="priority3"></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Naturally, we at Rethink Priorities should drop everything and focus on these.</p>
    <p>...Though we better be quick because I have a feeling these priorities may change soon. Check back here later and I'll keep you updated.</p>
