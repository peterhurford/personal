                  <p>Most of my reading is on the internet, but I do also like to read offline paper books.  So I've decided to keep a list, starting from the beginning of July 2011, and documenting all the books that I've read, the book I'm currently reading, and all the books I plan to read.  Books read in accordance with <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/cm/how_to_read/">my principles on how to read</a> -- summaries are provided for you to read before and after reading the book (or to decide whether to read the book); not to <i>replace</i> the book.  Books are graded like college universities -- just as universities are selective about the students they take, I'm selective about the books I read, and just as B is an average for those students, a B is an average for the books I read.  C- and below should feel bad.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Category - Self-development</li>
            <li>Why I read it? - I was looking for other popular and well-regarded self-development books, and this came up in my search.</li>
            <li>How I read it? - Audible</li>
            <li>Did I like it? - Rating D+.  This book felt too self-congratulatory and boring to me.</li>
            <li>Do I recommend it? - I suppose it's worth a shot because it's well-regarded, but it really didn't click for me.  Maybe try out the first chapter and see what you think?</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Category - Entrepreneurship</li>

            <li>Did I like it? - Rating A.</li>
            <li>Do I recommend it? - Yes.  The approach is excellent and the book is stunningly actionable.  A great companion to the more theoretical books, like "The Lean Startup".</li>
            <li>Summary I like - The book itself is already about as dense as it can get.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Category - Entrepreneurship</li>
            <li>Why I read it? - It was widely regarded as a classic in entrepreneurship.</li>
            <li>How I read it? - Audible</li>
            <li>Did I like it? - Rating A.</li>
            <li>Do I recommend it? - Yes.  I thought maybe I had already learned everything there is in this book since it's so widely cited and summarized elsewhere, but reading the source still proved important and insightful.  The case studies in the book were pretty cool.  The Lean Startup is common wisdom now, but it's fun to imagine how revolutionary it must have been at the time (2011 -- so old, huh).</li>

            <li>Did I like it? - Rating A+.</li>
            <li>Do I recommend it? - Yes.  Summarizes a wide degree of business information across many books and goes into detail on many different topics.  While I'm a bit wary of Kaufman for being one of those people who's only successful business was the business of telling other people how to run businesses, I think his information is pretty good.  There's also a lot of self-development info as well in the last half of the book, which is a nice bonus.</li>

            <li>Why I read it? - I felt like I needed to learn more about marketing, and this book was <a href="http://personalmba.com/best-business-books/">recommended by Josh Kaufman</a>.</li>
            <li>How I read it? - Audible</li>
            <li>Did I like it? - Rating D+.  The book was not what I was looking for.  It was too narrative for my taste -- read to me more like slam poetry than a textbook.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Category - Marketing</li>
            <li>Why I read it? - I felt like I needed to learn more about marketing, and "The 22 Immutable Laws of *Marketing*" was <a href="http://personalmba.com/best-business-books/">recommended by Josh Kaufman</a>.  I bought this one by mistake.</li>
            <li>How I read it? - Audible</li>
            <li>Did I like it? - Rating B-.  The book felt quite overconfident, but still was insightful and contained information I don't think I would find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Do I recommend it? - If you're interested in branding, yes.  It's super short.  So short that I thought it was a ripoff to buy it on Audible...  The summary leaves out a lot of the examples that make it possible to understand the laws, but the additional info offered by the book is still pretty marginal and might not be worth the money.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Category - Entrepreneurship</li>
            <li>Why I read it? - I was pretty sure it was recommended by either Sivers or Kaufman, but I can't find it on either of their lists...</li>
            <li>How I read it? - Audible</li>
            <li>Did I like it? - Rating A-.  I consider it an autobiography more than a business book.  I imagine it would be a lot more relevant to me if I was actually a CEO of a public company -- a lot of the advice is about hiring and firing exceutives, which is not something I need to know how to do.  But I still found the narrative to be quite compelling, and it was nice to find a book that was frank about the emotional struggles of being a CEO.</li>
            <li>Do I recommend it? - Yes, if you've read a few other entrepreneurship books.  Puts them in a good context.</li>

            <li>Category - Learning</li>
            <li>Why I read it? - I don't really care about learning <i>fast</i>, but I do care about learning.  I really liked what Kaufman had to offer in "The Personal MBA", so I'm eager to see what he has to offer here.</li>
            <li>How did I read it? - Audible</li>
            <li>Did I like it? - Rating B+.  The first half of the book was pretty useful in confirming what I already knew, and was well laid out.  The second half of the book where Kaufman talks about skills he learned was not useful, even as case studies of learning.</li>

            <li>Did I like it? - Rating C-.  It seemed like there were some nuggets of good advice, but there was a lot of woo -- such as the power of thinking positively, affirmations, etc.  There was so much woo that it made it difficult to trust the good advice, so I stopped reading.</li>

            <li>Did I like it? - Rating B.  I think the book overpromises and underdelivers a bit, but it's well organized.  Few of the tips were new to me and I think Winter is holding out on some of his advanced stuff, but it's still worth the read.</li>
