                    <p>Most of my reading is on the internet, but I do also like to read offline paper books.  So I've decided to keep a list, starting from the beginning of July 2011, and documenting all the books that I've read, the book I'm currently reading, and all the books I plan to read.</p>

					<p>Eventually, if I get around to it, I also plan to write blog posts reviewing all the books on this list that I've read.  But that goal may be too lofty.  I don't read books very fast, and I review them even slower...  Time will tell.</p>

					<p>Also,<br>
					[GOT] means that I personally own the book.<br>
					[GETTING] means I am in the process of getting the book and have it taken care of.<br>
					[LIB] means the book is available to me via my university library.<br>
					[LIB-GOT] means that I have the book checked out from my university library.<br>
					[NEED] means that I need to buy the book.  <i>(See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/161R3VB6T2YLZ/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_ws_e2hQqb04FNPEY">all of these in my Amazon Wishlist</a> if you're looking for gift ideas for me!)</i></p>
