                  <p>Most of my reading is on the internet, but I do also like to read offline paper books.  So I've decided to keep a list, starting from the beginning of July 2011, and documenting all the books that I've read, the book I'm currently reading, and all the books I plan to read.  Books read in accordance with <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/cm/how_to_read/">my principles on how to read</a> -- summaries are provided for you to read before and after reading the book (or to decide whether to read the book), not to <i>replace</i> the book.  Books are graded like college universities -- just as universities are selective about the students they take, I'm selective about the books I read, and just as B is an average for those students, a B is an average for the books I read.  C- and below should feel bad.</p>

            <li>Did I like it? - Rating B+.</li>
            <li>Do I recommend it? - Yes.  Not the highest priority self-development book (that would be Allen's "Getting Things Done"), but it's up there and I think people interested in self-dev should have some exposure to Ferriss's thoughts</li>
            <li>Summary I like - <a href="http://sivers.org/book/4HourWorkWeek">Sivers</a></li>
