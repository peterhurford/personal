"Alright the mould has been mailed, and you must go to the mailroom to get it.  After you get the mould, take it and place it inside the keyhole to the door in question.  Then go to your mail account and mail the mould back.  After mailing the mould back, call me again.  I will tell you how the analysis went, and I will tell you if I mailed you a key back or not.<br><br><ul>
