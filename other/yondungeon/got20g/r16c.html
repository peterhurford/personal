Thou attacks ye hitman and manages to smite all of them with thy longsword.  However, as thou watchiths thy hitman die, thy swordstalkers sneak up and grab thee.  Thy longsword is taken and ye swordstalkers escort you back to your cell -- wherever your cell was...  They then stand gaurd and tell you that you will be executed at midnight one day next week, Monday through Friday.  Furthermore, they say that the execution will be a surprise to you: you won't know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on your cell door at noon that day.
