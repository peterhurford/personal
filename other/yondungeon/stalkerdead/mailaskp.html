Ye mailman says, "Oh that?  That is a portaler.  It will open a stable quantum singularity, a quantum wormhole if you will, large enough to allow instantanious travel from one point to another.  If you press this button here..."  He shows you a big blue button in the center of the portaler.  "...it will create the said wormhole a few meters away from you and allow you to travel here.  However, please keep in mind this trip is one way.  If you choose to not go through the wormhole, press the blue button to close the singularity.  If you want to know more about it, you should go to your inventory and examine it.  Anyways, is that all?"<br><br><ul>
