Ye mailman says, "Oh that?  That is a forcefeild vaporizer.   It will turn off any forcefeild in the vacinety.  It does this by targeting the generators.  See, if you press this button here...."  He shows you a big red button in the center of the vaporizer.  "it will send a signal to the forcefield generator telling it to shutdown, overriding it to allowing passage through the forcefield in question.  If you want to know more about it, you should go to your inventory and examine it.  Anyways, is that all?"<br><br><ul>
