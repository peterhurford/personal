Ye mailman says, "That is very good then.  Thank you for opening an account.  Please note that this account comes with three features.  You will recieve an account, to which you can recieve mail and gifts in.  You will also be given a forcefield vaporizer, which will destroy any forcefields you come accross.  The third feature is a portaler, a device that will allow you to portal here at anytime so you can check your mail.  We would have also given you a map of this dungeon, but we ran out of then three customers ago, and cannot give you one.  We apologize."<br><br>Ye mailman continues jabbering, "To get an account, you will be given a transaction number.  This is so we can keep track of all of your mail, and keep it seperate from everyone elses mail.  Your account number is 4563238.  You will need to remember this number, so please write it down.  Anyways, thank you for creating an account.  We are pleased to be the best mailroom in this dungeon, mainly because of our quality and the fact that we are the only mailroom in this dungeon.  Thanks for listining.  You now have your account." Thou still hast strain thy ears to understand ye mailman's new english.  This new stuff is annoying.<br><br><ul>
