Letter #1:<br><br>From: <b>Luke</b><br>To: <b>Account #4563238</b><br>Subject: <b>Key Made</b><br>Message: <i>I have made the key to fit the lock, thanks to the mould you sent me.  Again, you must go to "accept gifts" to get it.  This key should work on the lock.  If it doesn't call me back and mail me the key.  However, I am fairly sure it will work.  Go for it, and thanks for using Luke's Meideval Locksmith!<br><br><ul>
