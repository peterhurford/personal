Letter #1:<br><br>From: <b>Thy Nemesis</b><br>To: <b>Account #4563238</b><br>Subject: <b>I'm Watching You!</b><br>Message: <i>Hello.  My hitmen spies have found you and are already to attack you.  I know that you were the one who killed my swordstalker gaurding the east room, and you were the one who escaped from his cell.  I also know that you have managed to unlock the blue door and are now preparing to rescue more prisoners from the southern dungeons.  I will not let you get away with this!  As a matter of fact, I am closing in on you right now.  Don't ask how I got your account number.  And don't trace this message.  You will not find me!<br><br><ul>
