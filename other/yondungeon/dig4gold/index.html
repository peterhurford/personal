Pre-alpha Version<br><br>
Welcome to Yon Dungeon!  This is a long, hard, and suspensful adventure game written in HTML.  This game is in no way complicated to play.  All you have to do is read the text... like this text here, and choose options, like the options below.  (This is basically a tutorial, right here.)  During the game you will be able to collect items, and use those items to advance further in the game.  You can get killed, or purpously kill yourself, if you wish.  Either way, have fun!  (Har means Go...  Please Note: This game is written in ye olde english)
