Thou ponders these statements, and then smiles. "If the hanging were on Friday," methinks, "then it wouldn't be a surprise; for I would know by Thursday night that I was going to be hanged on Friday, since no hanging had yet occurred and only one day was left. So the hanging can't be on Friday."<br><br>
"But," thou continues, "then the hanging can't be on Thursday either. If it were, then it wouldn't be a surprise either. For I would know on Wednesday night that I was going to be hanged on Thursday, since no hanging had yet occurred and only two days were left, one of which (Friday) I already know cannot be execution day. So a Thursday hanging is impossible too."
<br><br>Thou figures that similar reasoning shows that the hanging can't be on Wednesday, Tuesday, or even Monday! Thou returniths to thy cell confident in thy safety: "I have been sentenced not just to a hanging, but to a surprising hanging and one that must occur next week; but no hanging meeting both conditions can be carried out."
<br><br>The next week, the executioner knocks on his door at noon on Wednesday - an utter surprise. Everything the swordstalkers and hitman said has come true. Where was the flaw in thy reasoning?  No matter what, <b>*** GAME OVER ***</b>
