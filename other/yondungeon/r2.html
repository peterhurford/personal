Thou hars north and travels down a hallway for a few minutes.  Thou then finds thyself in a room with a rope coming from the top of ye dungeon.  Thy looks up and spys the fact that he is indeed at the bottom of ye well.  If thou climbed ye rope it would lead thou out of the well, and to victory.  Thou also spys an exit to the south, backith from whence ye came.  What doest thou do?
