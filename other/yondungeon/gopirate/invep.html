It is some sort of grey round handheld device about a quarter of a meter across.   It is called a portaler, and it is from some sort of future century.  It has a big shiny blue button in the center that apparently makes a stable quantum wormhole that you can travel through to breach great or little distances to the mailroom.  It is one way.  It was collected in a postal service you know nothing about.<br>
