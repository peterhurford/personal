Thou walks north, and finds ye general store.  There is a sign that says: "Pirate's General Store."  Thou tryisth thy door and it opens great!  The sign on the door says: "Ye Pirate is In!  WELCOME!"  Thou cannot tell if the sign is written in ye olde english or ye pirate speech, but they art similar enough.  Furthermore, thou notices a hole that thou has never noticed before.<br><br><ul>
