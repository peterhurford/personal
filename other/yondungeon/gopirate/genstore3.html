Ye pirate coughs and says, "You lookin' for some money, lad?  I have just the thing.  I buried me treasure a few years back somewhere in yon dungeon here.  If you can find it, it should give you 20 gold coins.  It was me small treasure, I have a larger one, but not in here... no siree.  Here, take me shovel.  With this, maybe you can dig up me treasure."<br><br><ul>
