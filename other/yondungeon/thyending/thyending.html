<!--   //		Thy Room Text		-->
Thy secratary appears from thy back room (that thou is not allowed to har in and is not supposed to thinks about) and says in ye perfect, pure, "modern" english, "Yes.  We have been tracking your progress for awhile.  You have broken down the door that prevented us from leaving this dungeon.  We are now free.  We have decided that for your great feats of bravery, we will accept you into the Legion of the Modern Knight's Rebellion, as we now have reason to believe that you are the rightful owner of this kingdom.  You see, this is how it has gone:  Recently, a group of knights rebelled against your placement in this dungeon, and rebelled against Thy Nemisis.  One hundred years in the future, we were doing temporal experiments to try to revisit the past in order to purify our history books of false knowlege recorded by people throughout time.  We accidently created a gap in space and your rebellion knights found us.  They argued that Thy Nemisis shouldn't exist, for a reason we can't tell you yet.  However, since we can't directly interfere with the past, we've decided to help you in secret...  Fight well." <br><br><ul>
