              <p><strong>Hi, I'm Peter Hurford.</strong> Along with my friend Marcus A. Davis, I am a co-founder and co-Executive Director of <a href="http://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, a think tank dedicated to figuring out the best ways to make the world a better place. We do research, mainly on <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/">improving the welfare and lives of nonhuman animals</a>. We also do some work to make sure <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/extinction-risk/">we all survive</a>, helping minimize the risks of civilization-ending events, like widespread nuclear war. Lastly, we try to help further build the community of people working on these issues. Rather than just doing what feels right, <a href="http://www.effectivealtruism.org">we use evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on</a>.</p>

              <p>I'm also a data scientist. I've used machine learning across a variety of disciplines - helping fight fraud, reduce insurance risk, improve healthcare outcomes, optimize store layouts, predict the results of sports games, forecast elections, get pets adopted, and improve consumer access to financial products. I've worked at <a href="http://datarobot.com/">DataRobot</a>, building automatic machine learning. I have a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/peterhurford/">Triple Master Rank on Kaggle</a> (an international data science competition) and have acheived top 1% performance in five different Kaggle competitions. I am an <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford">avid open source developer</a> and I love building tools to solve problems and make things easier.

              <p>When not working, I <a href="/blog">blog across the internet</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford">occasionally tweet</a>. I also <a href="/links">read articles</a>, <a href="other/reading.html">read books</a>, and <a href="other/television.html">watch the occasional TV</a>. I do not play the organ.</p>
