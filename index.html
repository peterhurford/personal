        <h1>Peter Wildeford</h1>
        <p>The United States faces a defining test of technology governance. Anthropic has declared <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6">"We build Claude with Claude"</a> and OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/">has said the same about ChatGPT</a>. Forget building the plane while flying it - the plane is now building itself while flying itself! I'm the <strong>Head of Policy</strong> at <strong><a href="https://theaipn.org/">The AI Policy Network</a></strong>, working to prepare for a future world with AI superintelligence.</p>
        <p>You might have seen me talking about AI on Good Morning America, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcPthlvzMY8">the Daily Show</a>, The Information, or TechCrunch. I'm a data scientist by training and a professional forecaster by practice, regularly reaching the top 1% in forecasting competitions. Before my current role, I co-founded two think tanks: the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy and Rethink Priorities.</p>
