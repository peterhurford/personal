                <p><strong>Hi, I'm Peter Hurford.</strong> I work at <a href="http://www.riseinteractive.com">Rise Interactive</a> as a <strong>Lead Data Scientist</strong> in Chicago, using machine learning to help companies match customers with the products they are most likely to buy. Previously, I worked at <a href="http://www.avant.com/">Avant</a>, using machine learning to reduce default rates and increase returns on marketing.</p>

                <p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford">an avid open source developer</a>. Recently, I made <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford/vowpal_platypus">Vowpal Platypus</a>, a general use, lightweight Python wrapper built on Vowpal Wabbit, that enables quick, accurate, versitile, lightweight, multi-core, out-of-core machine learning in Python. I've also made <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford/surveytools2">Surveytools2</a>, which makes it easier to analyze survey data; <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford/checkr">Checkr</a>, which brings type safety and automatic verification to R; and <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford/batchman">Batchman</a>, which lets you write batch functions in R. I also work with Vim and Bash: <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford/vimflow">Vimflow</a> brings Vim a quick navigation system and <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford/git-it-on.zsh">Git-it-on</a> makes it easy to navigate GitHub from the command line.

                <p>By night, I'm on the board of <a href="http://www.charitysciencehealth.com">Charity Science Health</a>, a non-profit that uses SMS reminders to boost immunization rates in India. I'm also on the board of <a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, a non-profit that researches the best way to help nonhuman animals (<a href="other/veg_research.html">I do research</a>). I'm also the co-founder and advisor to <a href="http://dotimpact.im/">.impact</a>, a non-profit building an international community of people who want to make the world a better place (a topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKX_xzUGEcI">I've given a TEDx talk about</a>).</p>

                <p>I <a href="/blog">blog across the internet</a> and also <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford">occasionally tweet</a>. I also <a href="other/reading.html">read</a> and <a href="other/television.html">watch the occasional TV</a>. I do not play the organ.</p>
