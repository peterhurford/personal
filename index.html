              <p><strong>Hi, I'm Peter Hurford.</strong> Along with my co-founder Marcus A. Davis, I am a co-Executive Director of <a href="http://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, a think tank dedicated to figuring out the best ways to make the world a better place. Right now, we're mainly focused on ensuring we all survive and that the lives of nonhuman animals go better. Rather than just doing what feels right, we use evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on. Learn more about this philosophy (called "effective altruism") <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">here</a>.</p>

              <p>I'm also a data scientist. I work at <a href="http://datarobot.com/">DataRobot</a>, where I use machine learning to help companies understand their data and develop insights. I previously have been employed using machine learning to improve advertising outcomes, fight fraud, and help improve people's access to financial products. I'm an <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford">avid open source developer</a> and love building tools to solve problems and make things easier.

              <p>I <a href="/blog">blog across the internet</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford">occasionally tweet</a>. I also <a href="other/reading.html">read</a> and <a href="other/television.html">watch the occasional TV</a>. I do not play the organ.</p>
