              <p><strong>Hi, I'm Peter Hurford.</strong> Along with my co-founder Marcus A. Davis, I am a co-Executive Director of <a href="http://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, a think tank dedicated to figuring out the best ways to make the world a better place. Right now, we're mainly focused on ensuring <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/extinction-risk/">we all survive</a> and that <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/">the lives of nonhuman animals go better</a>. Rather than just doing what feels right, <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org">we use evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on</a>.</p>

              <p>I'm also a data scientist. I work at <a href="http://datarobot.com/">DataRobot</a>, where I use machine learning to help companies understand their data and develop insights. I previously have been employed using machine learning to improve advertising outcomes, fight fraud, and help improve people's access to financial products. I have a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/peterhurford/">Triple Master Rank on Kaggle</a> (an international data science competition) and have acheived top 1% performance in five different Kaggle competitions. Lastly, I am an <a href="https://github.com/peterhurford">avid open source developer</a> and I love building tools to solve problems and make things easier.

              <p>When not working, I <a href="/blog">blog across the internet</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterhurford">occasionally tweet</a>. I also <a href="/links">read articles</a>, <a href="other/reading.html">read books</a>, and <a href="other/television.html">watch the occasional TV</a>. I do not play the organ.</p>
              
              <p>The best way to reach me is by email: <a href="mailto:peter@peterhurford.com">peter@peterhurford.com</a></p>
