        <h1>Peter Wildeford</h1>
        <p>I'm the Head of Policy at the AI Policy Network, where I work on shaping how we govern emerging technologies. You might have seen me talking about AI on Good Morning America, the Daily Show, The Information, or TechCrunch.</p>
        <p>I'm a data scientist by training and a professional forecaster by practice, specializing in geopolitics, global conflict, national security, and emerging technology. Before my current role, I co-founded two think tanks: the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy and Rethink Priorities.</p>
        <p>I write about forecasting, AI, and making sense of the future on my <a href="https://peterwildeford.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/peterwildeford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>.</p>
